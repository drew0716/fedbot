Is the Federal Reserve aware of ongoing payment delays for consumers and businesses that started on November 3, 2023?
Yes. The Federal Reserve encourages banks to work quickly to resolve issues for customers experiencing delays in receiving direct deposit payments as a result of operational issues at a private sector payments provider. The Federal Reserve's payments services are separate and functioned normally.
