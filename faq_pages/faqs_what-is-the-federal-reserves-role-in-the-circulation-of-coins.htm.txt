What is the Federal Reserve’s role in the circulation of coins?
The Federal Reserve plays a purely distributional role in the circulation of coins.
As the nation's issuing authority for coins, the U.S. Mint is responsible for coin production. On behalf of the U.S. Mint, Federal Reserve Banks distribute coins to banks and credit unions.
These financial institutions provide coins directly to individuals and businesses. The Federal Reserve
does not
provide coins directly to businesses or consumers.
For more information on coins, see the
U.S. Mint's website
