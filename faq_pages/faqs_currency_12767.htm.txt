What is the Federal Reserve's role in the design of United States currency?
The Federal Reserve is one member of an interagency committee that makes recommendations on U.S. currency design changes. These recommendations are made to the Secretary of the Treasury, who has final authority for U.S. currency designs by law.
The Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence (ACD) Steering Committee is comprised of the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the United States Secret Service. The ACD Steering Committee continuously monitors counterfeiting threats for each denomination of U.S. currency and makes redesign recommendations based on these threats, among other factors.
