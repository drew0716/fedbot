Which denominations of currency does the Federal Reserve issue?
The Federal Reserve Board currently issues $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 notes. The largest denomination Federal Reserve note ever issued for public circulation was the $10,000 note.
On July 14, 1969, the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury announced that banknotes in denominations of
$500
,
$1,000
,
$5,000
, and
$10,000
would be discontinued due to lack of use. Although they were issued until 1969, they were last printed in 1945.
