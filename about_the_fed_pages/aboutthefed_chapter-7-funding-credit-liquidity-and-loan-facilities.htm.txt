70.01 General
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve created a number of facilities to support the economy during the downturn. The following sections provide information on the background and accounts of each facility program.
70.20 Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (145-400, 145-415, 145-430, 145-445, 145-460, 145-515, 145-530, and 145-575)
In March 2020, the Federal Reserve Board announced a program to support the credit needs of consumers and businesses by facilitating the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) and improving the market conditions for ABS more generally. Under the TALF II LLC, the FRBNY provides loans to eligible issuers of ABS. The loans purchased by the TALF II are not designated as held for sale and therefore are held for investment under FASB ASC Topic 310,
Receivables
. The loans will be recorded at the cost basis. The FRBNY is the primary beneficiary of the TALF II, and its assets and liabilities are consolidated for financial reporting purposes with those of the FRBNY. The primary asset accounts related to the loan facility and the TALF II are described below.

70.30 Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility
In April 2020, the Federal Reserve Board announced an emergency lending program to facilitate lending to small businesses. The Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility (PPPLF) bolstered the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP Loans) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Under the PPPLF, the Federal Reserve Banks will lend to eligible borrowers on a non-recourse basis, taking PPP loans as collateral. The covered PPP loans are fully guaranteed as to principal and accrued interest by the SBA, the amount of each being determined at the time the guarantee is exercised. However, these loans still must be evaluated for collectability on at least a quarterly basis. Per ASC Topic 860,
Transfers and Servicing
, the borrower's pledge of collateral will, therefore, be accounted for as a collateral-secured loan by both the borrower and the Reserve Banks.
70.50 Main Street Lending Program
In April 2020, the Main Street Lending Program (Program) was established to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses under the CARES Act. The Program will operate through five facilities: the Main Street New Loan Facility (MSNLF), the Main Street Priority Loan Facility (MSPLF), the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility (MSELF), the Nonprofit Organization New Loan Facility (NONLF), and the Nonprofit Organization Expanded Loan Facility (NOELF). The Federal Reserve authorized the FRBB under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to lend to MS Facilities LLC (an SPV) through which these facilities will operate. The FRBB is the primary beneficiary of this SPV, and its assets and liabilities are consolidated for financial reporting purposes into the FRBB. Loan participations purchased under each of the five facilities described below are recorded at the cost of purchase and treated as loans under ASC 310,
