Fine Arts Program
The Federal Reserve Board's Fine Arts Program was established in 1975 by former Chairman Arthur F. Burns in response to a White House directive encouraging federal partnership with the arts. In a 1971 letter from the White House, Richard Nixon wrote, "It is my urgent desire that the growing partnership between Government and the arts continue to be developed to the benefit of both and more particularly to the benefit of the people of America." Chairman Burns saw this as an opportunity to both enhance the working environment at the Board and to provide its visitors with a memorable visual experience. He created the Fine Arts Program to collect and care for artwork and to organize exhibitions for display in the historic Marriner S. Eccles building.
As with all federal agencies, the Board may receive gifts of artwork, as well as funds to purchase works of art. The Board is dependent on these donations to build its collection, which includes drawings, paintings, photographs, prints, and sculptures.
Fine Arts Program Exhibitions
The Federal Reserve Board presents a series of exhibitions annually, which are displayed in the Eccles building. Currently there are no special exhibitions on view.
