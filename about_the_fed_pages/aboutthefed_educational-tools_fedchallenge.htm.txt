What Participants Can Expect & National Guidelines
Team Presentations (15-minute maximum)
Teams make presentations to a panel of judges who are experts in economics and monetary policy. Presentations should consist of the following elements:
An analysis of current economic conditions (as of the day of the competition); these conditions may include broad macroeconomic conditions as well as conditions experienced in different geographic areas, in urban/rural areas, or among different demographic and socioeconomic groups (e.g., racial and ethnic groups, age groups), borrowers and savers, etc.
A forecast of near-term economic and financial conditions relevant to the formulation of monetary policy
A discussion of significant risks to the economy that should receive special attention in formulating monetary policy; these risks may include the possible effects (positive or negative) of monetary policies on different segments of the population
A monetary policy recommendation, encompassing both traditional tools and newer approaches as warranted; presenters should give supporting reasons for their recommendation
Questions and Answers (15-minute maximum)
Following the presentation, teams answer questions from the judges about recommendations made in the presentation and macroeconomic theory as well as hypothetical questions or questions about the Fed.
Scoring
Judges evaluate and score the teams on economic analysis, responses to questions, teamwork, and presentation. The team with the highest score wins.
