under
"Team Presentations and Scoring
."
Create a Club or Organization Using these Five Main Steps:
Get involved in similar student organizations and see if they have a sub-team of a club dedicated to the Fed Challenge, if so get involved, if not:
Create a club and team as a separate organization. Sometimes this is housed in a campus's career services, but each school may differ.
Meet with your Economic Department Director or equivalent for career services and other faculty members to garner support.
If starting a club from scratch, plan out your mission statement, objectives (see sample objectives below), the structure of the overall club, and the resources needed.
Use a
fillable poster
around campus to promote competition participation.
Once you obtain official approval to be a new organization and possibly secure support from the department for marketing materials, you may:
go to lectures to pitch the club
email other organizations to raise awareness
hand out flyers
attend the campus career fair
use personal networks to get students interested
Sample Objectives of a Fed Challenge Team/Club:
Develop job relevant skills in all Fed Challenge club members
Make all members (some clubs have about 3-5 "analysts" that support each presentation member) responsible for specific research objectives and require them to present their findings
Developing research, leadership, time management, and presentation skills
Get members certified in different statistical and financial software platforms.
Expose members to different career paths within economics and finance
Bring in speakers, as possible through:
Professors
PhD students in economics
Current employees at the Federal Reserve
Private sector finance professionals
Attend economic conferences in local area
Develop, refine, and execute a solid presentation that can be used as a template (year over year) for future generations of the club as a reference.
Cultivate leaders within the club to develop a pipeline of talent to lead the organization moving forward
Institute a mentorship program to foster relationships between experienced and less experienced member
