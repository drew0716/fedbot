National High School Fed Challenge
The Federal Reserve System High School Fed Challenge offers the opportunity for students to develop skills in teamwork, research, data literacy, and analytical writing. Student teams author economics research and pursue an opportunity to be published in the
Journal of Future Economists
.
What is the High School Fed Challenge?
The High School Fed Challenge is an educational program that aims to encourage students in grades 9-12 to learn more about economics and promote interest in economics as a subject for study and the basis for a career. Previous study of economics is not required â€“ only intellectual curiosity and interest in exploring an economic theme.
The High School Fed Challenge designates the annual competition theme. Entering teams may select any topic that explicitly relates to this theme for academic research, which will be submitted for evaluation to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Federal Reserve personnel select submissions to be published in the
Journal of Future Economists
.
In addition to gaining broader exposure to the field of economics, all entering school teams will receive recognition in the
Journal of Future Economists
.
For schools that have been approved for the New York State Education Department's
Seal of Civic Readiness + 1 Civics Pathway
, the High School Fed Challenge academic competition can be used as a 1-point research project to count towards the Seal of Civic Readiness 6-point requirement.
