Appointment. The Board may appoint a conservator or receiver to take possession and control of any uninsured State member bank which operates, or operates as, a multilateral clearing organization pursuant to section 409 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 to the same extent and in the same manner as the Comptroller of the Currency may appoint a conservator or receiver for a national bank.
Powers. The conservator or receiver for an uninsured State member bank referred to in paragraph (1) shall exercise the same powers, functions, and duties, subject to the same limitations, as a conservator or receiver for a national bank.
(b) Board Authority.
The Board shall have the same authority with respect to any conservator or receiver appointed under subsection (a), and the uninsured State member bank for which the conservator or receiver has been appointed, as the Comptroller of the Currency has with respect to a conservator or receiver for a national bank and the national bank for which the conservator or receiver has been appointed.
(c) Bankruptcy Proceedings.
The Board (in the case of an uninsured State member bank which operates, or operates as, such a multilateral clearing organization) may direct a conservator or receiver appointed for the bank to file a petition pursuant to title 11, United States Code, in which case, title 11, United States Code, shall apply to the bank in lieu of otherwise applicable Federal or State insolvency law.
