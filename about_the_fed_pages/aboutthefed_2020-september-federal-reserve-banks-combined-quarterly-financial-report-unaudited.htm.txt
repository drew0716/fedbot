Supplemental Financial Information
(1) Credit and Liquidity Facilities
The Federal Reserve is using its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Pursuant to section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) and after obtaining the requisite approval from the Secretary of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve established facilities with broad-based eligibility. The Board of Governors established three lending facilities (note 2) and formed five limited liability companies (LLCs, note 4) for additional lending programs to provide liquidity to various sectors of the economy. The structure and objective of these lending facilities are outlined in the
table 1
:

Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the Treasury provided credit protection for CCF, MUNI, TALF II, and Main Street. The Treasury is a non-controlling member of and contributed equity to function as credit protection for the LLCs. Additionally, the Treasury provided credit protection to MMLF and CPFF.
(2) Loans
Loans to Depository Institutions
The Reserve Banks offer primary, secondary, and seasonal loans to eligible borrowers (depository institutions that maintain reservable transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits and have established discount window borrowing privileges). Primary and secondary loans are extended on a short-term basis, typically overnight, whereas seasonal loans may be extended for a period of up to nine months.
Other Loans
MMLF, PPPLF, and PDCF were established pursuant to section 13(3) of the FRA (note 1). The Treasury contributed $1.5 billion as credit protection for the MMLF, which is reported on the Combined statements of condition as "Treasury credit protection provided for lending facility."
The PPPLF program extends credit to eligible financial institutions that originate Paycheck Protection Program loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value.
The amounts outstanding at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, for loans to depository institutions and other loans were as follows:

1. The par amount shown for federal agency and GSE residential MBS and commercial MBS is the remaining principal balance of the securities.
Return to table
Federal agency and GSE residential MBS (RMBS) and commercial MBS (CMBS) are reported at stated maturity in table 7 above. The estimated weighted-average lives of the federal agency and GSE RMBS and CMBS differ from the stated maturity in table 7 primarily because these estimated weighted-average lives factor in scheduled payments and prepayment assumptions. The estimated weighted-average life of federal agency and GSE RMBS was approximately 3.4 years and 5.3 years as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the federal agency and GSE CMBS was approximately 9.1 years as of September 30, 2020.
Information about transactions related to Treasury securities, federal agency and GSE MBS, and GSE debt securities held in the SOMA during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, is summarized as follows:

At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the fair value of foreign currency denominated investments held in the SOMA was $21,635 million and $20,829 million, respectively.
Because of the global character of bank funding markets, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorized and directed the FRBNY to maintain U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with foreign central banks. As of December 31, 2019, and September 30, 2020, the FRBNY had standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. On March 19, 2020, the FRBNY entered into temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements to be in place for at least six months with the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Danmarks Nationalbank (Denmark), the Bank of Korea, the Banco de Mexico, the Norges Bank (Norway), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden). On July 29, 2020, these swap lines were extended through March 31, 2021. The FRBNY holds amounts outstanding under these swap lines in the SOMA.
The remaining maturity distribution of U.S. dollar liquidity swaps that were allocated to the Reserve Banks at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, was as follows:

(4) Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
The combined financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of CPFF II, CCF, Main Street, MUNI, and TALF II. The Reserve Banks that are controlling members have extended loans to the VIEs under the authority of section 13(3) of the FRA. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Purchases of each LLC's portfolio assets are funded by loans extended by the controlling Reserve Bank. The assets of the VIE and the amounts provided by the Treasury as credit protection are used to secure the loan from the Reserve Bank.
The classification of assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2020, are as follows:

Return to table
The allocation of the excess of net unconsolidated VIE assets is determined in accordance with the limited liability company agreement for each entity. The hypothetical liquidation basis of valuation (HLBV) is applied in determining the allocation. Under the HLBV, the hypothetical liquidation of the VIE at book value forms the basis for allocating income or loss and net assets between its controlling and non-controlling interest holders.
(5) Federal Reserve Notes
Federal Reserve notes are the circulating currency of the United States. These notes, which are identified as issued to a specific Reserve Bank, must be fully collateralized. All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized.
(6) Depository Institution Deposits
Depository institutions' deposits primarily represent the balances in the master accounts and excess balance accounts that depository institutions hold at the Reserve Banks. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances. Effective March 26, 2020, reserve requirements were removed and all balances held are excess balances.
(7) Treasury Deposits
The Treasury holds deposits at the Reserve Banks in a general account pursuant the Reserve Banks' role as fiscal agent and depositary of the United States.
(8) Capital and Surplus
The FRA requires that each member bank subscribe to the capital stock of the Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 percent of the capital and surplus of the member bank. These shares have a par value of $100, and may not be transferred or hypothecated. As a member bank's capital and surplus changes, its holdings of Reserve Bank stock must be adjusted. Currently, only one-half of the subscription is paid in, and the remainder is subject to call. A member bank is liable for Reserve Bank liabilities up to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it.
The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semi-annually and is cumulative.
The FRA limits aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to $6.825 billion.
The Treasury equity contribution to the consolidated VIEs is reported as an element of "Non-controlling interests in consolidated variable interest entities formed to administer credit and liquidity facilities" in the Combined statements of condition. The reported amount also includes Treasury's allocated portion of undistributed net VIE assets as of September 30, 2020, determined in accordance with VIE agreements and accounting policies adopted by the VIEs.
(9) Income and Expense
(A) Loans to Depository Institutions and Other Loans
Interest income on primary, secondary, and seasonal credit is accrued using the applicable rate established at least every 14 days by the Reserve Banks' boards of directors, subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors. Interest income on advances made under the MMLF, PPPLF, and PDCF is accrued using the applicable rate as outlined by the term sheets of the respective programs.
Supplemental information on interest income on loans and other loans, net is as follows:

(D) Depository Institution Deposits
The Reserve Banks pay interest to depository institutions on qualifying balances held at the Reserve Banks. The interest rates paid on required reserve balances and excess balances are determined by the Board of Governors, based on a FOMC-established target range for the federal funds rate. Effective March 26, 2020, the Board of Governors has reduced reserve requirements ratios to zero. This action eliminates reserve requirements for thousands of depository institutions and will help to support lending to households and businesses.
The Reserve Banks also offer term deposits through the Term Deposit Facility, and all depository institutions that are eligible to receive interest on their balances at the Reserve Banks may participate in the term deposit program. The interest rate paid on these deposits is determined by auction.
(E) Operating Expenses
The Federal Reserve Banks have established procedures for budgetary control and monitoring of operating expenses as part of their efforts to ensure appropriate stewardship and accountability. Reserve Bank and Board governance bodies provide budget guidance for major functional areas for the upcoming budget year. The Board's Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Affairs (BAC) reviews the Banks' budgets and the BAC chair submits the budgets to Board members for review and final action. Throughout the year, Reserve Bank and Board staffs monitor actual performance and compare it with approved budgets and forecasts.
Certain amounts relating to the prior year have been reclassified in the Combined statements of operations to conform to the current year presentation. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update 2017-07,
Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost
, $42 million previously reported as "Operating expenses: System pension service cost" have been reclassified as "Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits" for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Additional information regarding Reserve Bank operating expenses is available each year in the Annual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at
https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report.htm
, and on the Audit webpage of the Board's website at
