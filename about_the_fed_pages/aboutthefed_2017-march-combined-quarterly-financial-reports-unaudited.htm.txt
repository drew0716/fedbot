Return to table
Federal agency and GSE MBS are reported at stated maturity in table 5 above. The estimated weighted-average life of these securities, which differs from the stated maturity in table 5 primarily because it factors in scheduled payments and prepayment assumptions, was approximately 7.2 years as of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.
Information about transactions related to Treasury securities, GSE debt securities, and federal agency and GSE MBS held in the SOMA during the three months ended March 31, 2017, and during the year ended December 31, 2016, is summarized as follows:

At March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the fair value of foreign currency denominated investments held in the SOMA was $19,981 million and $19,510 million, respectively.
Because of the global character of bank funding markets, the Federal Reserve has at times coordinated with other central banks to provide liquidity. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorized and directed the FRBNY to maintain standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The FRBNY holds amounts outstanding under these swap lines in the SOMA. These swap lines, which were originally established as temporary arrangements, were converted to standing arrangements on October 31, 2013, and will remain in place until further notice.
The remaining maturity distribution of U.S. dollar liquidity swaps that were allocated to the Reserve Banks at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, was as follows:

(4) Federal Reserve Notes
Federal Reserve notes are the circulating currency of the United States. These notes, which are identified as issued to a specific Reserve Bank, must be fully collateralized. All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized.
(5) Depository Institution Deposits
Depository institution deposits are primarily comprised of required reserve balances and excess reserve balances. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances.
(6) Treasury Deposits
The Treasury holds deposits at the Reserve Banks in a general account pursuant the Reserve Banks' role as fiscal agent and depositary of the United States.
(7) Capital and Surplus
The Federal Reserve Act (FRA) requires that each member bank subscribe to the capital stock of the Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 percent of the capital and surplus of the member bank. These shares are nonvoting, with a par value of $100, and may not be transferred or hypothecated. As a member bank's capital and surplus changes, its holdings of Reserve Bank stock must be adjusted. Currently, only one-half of the subscription is paid in, and the remainder is subject to call. A member bank is liable for Reserve Bank liabilities up to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it.
The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semiannually and is cumulative.
The FRA limits aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to $10 billion.
(8) Income and Expense
(A) Loans
Interest income on primary, secondary, and seasonal credit is accrued using the applicable rate established at least every 14 days by the Reserve Banks' boards of directors, subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, primary, secondary, and seasonal credit average daily balances were $15 million and $40 million, respectively, and average interest rates were 1.16 percent and 0.82 percent, respectively.

(C) Depository Institution Deposits
The Reserve Banks pay interest to depository institutions on qualifying balances held at the Reserve Banks. The interest rates paid on required reserve balances and excess balances are determined by the Board of Governors, based on a FOMC-established target range for the federal funds rate.
In May 2010, the Reserve Banks commenced the auction of term deposits to be offered through its Term Deposit Facility. The interest rate paid on these deposits is determined by auction.
(D) Operating Expenses
The Federal Reserve Banks have established procedures for budgetary control and monitoring of operating expenses as part of their efforts to ensure appropriate stewardship and accountability. Reserve Bank and Board governance bodies provide budget guidance for major functional areas for the upcoming budget year. The Board's Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Affairs (BAC) reviews the Banks' budgets and the BAC chair submits the budgets to Board members for review and final action. Throughout the year, Reserve Bank and Board staffs monitor actual performance and compare it with approved budgets and forecasts.
Additional information regarding Reserve Bank operating expenses is available each year in the Annual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at
www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report/default.htm
, and on the Audit webpage of the Board's public website at
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_audit.htm
