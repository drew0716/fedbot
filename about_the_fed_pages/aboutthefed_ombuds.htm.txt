What is retaliation?
Retaliation is defined as any action or decision by Reserve Bank or Board staff that causes a supervised institution or its employees (“supervised persons”) to be treated differently or more harshly than other similarly situated institutions because the supervised person attempted to resolve a complaint by filing an appeal of a material supervisory determination or utilized any other Board mechanisms for resolving complaints.
Retaliation includes, but is not limited to, delaying or denying action that might benefit a supervised person without a sound supervisory reason or subjecting a supervised institution to heightened examination standards without a sound supervisory reason.
How can a supervised person submit a claim of retaliation?
A supervised person may submit a claim of retaliation with the Board's Ombuds by e-mail at
[email protected]
or by phone at 1-800-337-0429.
Ombuds Practices
Independence
The Ombuds operates independently of the Federal Reserve System's supervisory and regulatory processes.
Confidentiality
The Ombuds has established safeguards to protect confidentiality. Except in unusual circumstances, the Ombuds will not disclose information or material provided by a complainant, including identity, unless expressly authorized by the complainant in order to assist in resolving an issue.
Fairness and Integrity
The Board of Governors has a strict anti-retaliation policy. The Ombuds is responsible for receiving, reviewing, and deciding any complaints that a member of Federal Reserve System staff acted in a retaliatory manner against a supervised institution.
Other Resources
Consumer questions and complaints:
Independent of the Ombuds function, the Federal Reserve System maintains a
consumer help program
to assist individuals who are experiencing issues with their financial institutions.
Institutions supervised by other regulators:
The Federal Reserve System regulates state member banks, bank holding companies, and some other types of financial institutions. The other financial regulatory agencies also have Ombuds programs.
