Federal Reserve Oral History Interviews
In connection with the centennial anniversary of the Federal Reserve in 2013, the Board undertook an oral history project to collect personal recollections of a range of former Governors and staff members, including their background and education before working at the Board; important economic, monetary policy, and regulatory developments during their careers; and impressions of the institution's culture.
Following the interview, each participant was given the opportunity to edit and revise the transcript. In some cases, the Board staff also removed confidential Federal Open Market Committee and Board material in accordance with records retention and disposition schedules covering Federal Open Market Committee and Board records that were approved by the National Archives and Records Administration.
Note that the views of the participants and interviewers are their own and are not in any way approved or endorsed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Because the conversations are based on personal recollections, they may include misstatements and errors.
