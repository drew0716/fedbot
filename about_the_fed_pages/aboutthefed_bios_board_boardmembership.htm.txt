Board of Governors Members, 1914-Present
The first Federal Reserve Board was officially sworn in on August 10, 1914. Over the years, the Board's leadership structure has evolved and adapted in the System's efforts to serve effectively the nation, the economy, and the American public.
Statutory changes to the Board's leadership structure occurred over time: one in 1922, major changes in 1935, and additional changes in 1977, 2010, and 2015. For a complete list of all Board members from 1914 to present, see the
table
at the bottom of this page.
Leadership Structure: 1914-36
Initially, the Federal Reserve Board consisted of seven members:
The Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency, who were members ex officio (members by virtue of their office).
The U.S. President appointed the other five members, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
Of the five members appointed by the President, the President designated one as "governor" and one as "vice governor." The governor of the Federal Reserve Board, subject to its supervision, was the active executive officer.
The Act of June 3, 1922, increased the number of members appointed by the President from five to six.

Leadership Structure: 1936-Present
The Banking Act of 1935 made several changes in the nomenclature and the structure of the Board.  The Banking Act of 1935 renamed the "Federal Reserve Board" as the "Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System," the "governor" of the Board as the "chairman" and the "vice governor" as the "vice chairman" of the Board, and renamed "members" of the Board as "governors." The Banking Act of 1935 also made the following more structural changes:
increased the number of members of the Board appointed by the President from six to seven
required the President to designate one of the persons appointed as "chairman" of the Board and one as "vice chairman" of the Board, each to serve in such role for a term of four years
specified that the appointive members in office on the date of the act should continue to serve until February 1, 1936, or until their successors were appointed and had qualified; thereafter, the members' terms should be 14 years
specified that the ex officio members in office on the date of the act (the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency) were to continue to serve as ex officio members only until February 1, 1936, but made no further provision for ex officio members
provided that the "chairman of the Board, subject to its supervision, shall be its active executive officer"
The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 required the President to designate one of the persons appointed as "Chairman of the Board," by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and one as "Vice Chairman of the Board," by and with the consent of the Senate. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 required the President to designate, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a new "Vice Chairman for Supervision," who "shall develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution holding companies and other financial firms supervised by the Board and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms." A 2015 statute required that the President, in selecting members of the Board, "shall appoint at least one member with demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks having less than $10 billion in total assets."
