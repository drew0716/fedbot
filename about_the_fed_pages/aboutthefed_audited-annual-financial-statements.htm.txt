The Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Banks, and the limited liability company (LLC) consolidated with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston are all subject to several levels of audit and review. The Reserve Banks' and LLC’s financial statements are audited annually by an independent public accounting firm retained by the Board of Governors. To ensure auditor independence, the Board requires that the external auditor be independent in all matters relating to the audit. Specifically, the external auditor may not perform services for the Reserve Banks, the LLC, or affiliates that would place it in a position of auditing its own work, making management decisions on behalf of the Reserve Banks or the LLC, or in any other way impairing its audit independence. The financial statement audits of the Reserve Banks and the LLC are in accordance with applicable standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Reserve Banks and LLC are subject to oversight by the Board.
The Board of Governors' financial statements are audited annually by an independent public accounting firm retained by the Board's Office of Inspector General, and the audit is conducted in accordance with the generally accepted government auditing standards. The Office of Inspector General also conducts audits, reviews, and investigations relating to the Board's programs and operations as well as of Board functions delegated to the Reserve Banks.

The financial statements of the Board of Governors and the LLC are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP); those of the Federal Reserve Banks are prepared in accordance with the Financial Accounting Manual for Federal Reserve Banks (Financial Accounting Manual). Accounting principles for entities with the unique powers and responsibilities of the nation's central bank have not been formulated by accounting standard-setting bodies. The Board of Governors has developed specialized accounting principles and practices that it considers to be appropriate for the nature and function of a central bank. These accounting principles and practices are documented in the Financial Accounting Manual.
Due to the unique nature of the Reserve Banks' powers and responsibilities as part of the nation’s central bank and given the System’s unique responsibility to conduct monetary policy, the Board of Governors has adopted accounting principles and practices in the FAM that differ from GAAP. The more significant differences are the presentation of all SOMA securities holdings at amortized cost, adjusted for credit impairment, if any, and the recording of all SOMA securities on a settlement-date basis. Amortized cost, rather than the fair value presentation, more appropriately reflects the financial position associated with the Reserve Banks’ securities holdings given the System’s unique responsibility to conduct monetary policy. Although the application of fair value measurements to the securities holdings may result in values substantially greater or less than their carrying values, these unrealized changes in value have no direct effect on the quantity of reserves available to the banking system or on the ability of the Reserve Banks, as the central bank, to meet their financial obligations and responsibilities. Both the domestic and foreign components of the SOMA portfolio may involve transactions that result in gains or losses when holdings are sold before maturity. Decisions regarding securities and foreign currency transactions, including their purchase and sale, are primarily motivated by monetary policy and financial stability objectives rather than profit. Accordingly, fair values, earnings, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of such securities and currencies are incidental to the open market operations and do not motivate decisions related to policy or open market activities. Accounting for these securities on a settlement-date basis, rather than the trade-date basis required by GAAP, better reflects the timing of the transaction’s effect on the quantity of reserves in the banking system.
In addition, the Reserve Banks do not present a Statement of Cash Flows as required by GAAP because the liquidity and cash positions of the Reserve Banks are not a primary concern given the Reserve Banks' unique powers and responsibilities as a central bank. Other information regarding the Reserve Banks' activities is provided in, or may be derived from, the Statements of Condition, Operations, and Changes in Capital. Other than those described above, the accounting policies described in FAM are generally consistent with those in GAAP.
