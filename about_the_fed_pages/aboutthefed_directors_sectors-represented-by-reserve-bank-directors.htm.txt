1. The Federal Reserve Act requires that Class C and Class B directors be selected to represent the public “with due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers.” Also by statute, Class A directors, who are not shown on this table, are elected by member banks in their respective Federal Reserve Districts to represent those banks. This table includes all Class C and Class B directors serving on Reserve Bank boards as of January 1 of each calendar year.
