FRBNY to maintain standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The FRBNY holds amounts outstanding under these swap lines in the SOMA. These swap lines, which were originally established as temporary arrangements, were converted to standing arrangements on October 31, 2013, and will remain in place until further notice. The remaining maturity distribution of U.S. dollar liquidity swaps that were allocated to the Reserve Banks at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, was as follows: Table 9. Maturity distribution of liquidity swaps (in millions) March 31, 2017 Within 15 days December 31, 2016 Within 15 days Euro $ 4,525 $ 4,340 Japanese yen 550 1,223 Total $ 5,075 $ 5,563 The following table presents the realized gains (losses) and the change in the cumulative unrealized gains (losses) related to SOMA domestic securities holdings during the periods ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016: Table 10.

Realized gains (losses), net for federal agency and GSE MBS are reported in "Non-interest income (loss): System Open Market Account: Federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities (losses) gains, net" in the Combined statements of operations. Return to table 2. Because SOMA securities are recorded at amortized cost, the change in the cumulative unrealized gains (losses), net is not reported in the Combined statements of operations. Return to table (3) Consolidated Variable Interest Entity (VIE) The combined financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of a limited liability company (LLC), Maiden Lane LLC (ML), which is consolidated by the FRBNY. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The classification of significant assets and liabilities of ML at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, is summarized in the following table: Table 11. Assets and liabilities of consolidated VIE (in millions) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Assets Short-term investments $ 1,620 $ 1,618 Swap contracts 26 28 Other investments 19 17 Subtotal 1,665 $ 1,663 Cash, cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable, and other receivables 77 79 Total investments held by consolidated VIE $ 1,742 $ 1,742 Liabilities Swap contracts $ 27 $ 32 Cash collateral on swap contracts 8 1 Total liabilities held by consolidated VIE $ 35 $ 33 ML incurred net losses of $2 million and net income of $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016, respectively. The FRBNY will continue to sell the remaining assets from the ML portfolio as market conditions warrant and if the sales represent good value for the public. In accordance with the ML agreements, proceeds from future asset sales will be distributed to the FRBNY as contingent interest after all derivative instruments in ML have been terminated and paid or sold from the portfolio. (4) Federal Reserve Notes Federal Reserve notes are the circulating currency of the United States. These notes, which are identified as issued to a specific Reserve Bank, must be fully collateralized. All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized. (5) Depository Institution Deposits Depository institution deposits are primarily comprised of required reserve balances and excess reserve balances. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances. (6) Treasury Deposits The Treasury holds deposits at the Reserve Banks in a general account pursuant the Reserve Banks' role as fiscal agent and depositary of the United States. (7) Capital and Surplus The Federal Reserve Act (FRA) requires that each member bank subscribe to the capital stock of the Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 percent of the capital and surplus of the member bank. These shares are nonvoting, with a par value of $100, and may not be transferred or hypothecated. As a member bank's capital and surplus changes, its holdings of Reserve Bank stock must be adjusted. Currently, only one-half of the subscription is paid in, and the remainder is subject to call. A member bank is liable for Reserve Bank liabilities up to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it. The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semiannually and is cumulative. The FRA limits aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to $10 billion. (8) Income and Expense (A) Loans Interest income on primary, secondary, and seasonal credit is accrued using the applicable rate established at least every 14 days by the Reserve Banks' boards of directors, subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors.
