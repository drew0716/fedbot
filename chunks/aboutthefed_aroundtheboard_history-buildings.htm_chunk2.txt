Eccles, who served as Chair of the Federal Reserve from 1934–1948. The Board acquired the present site on Constitution Avenue—including the vacant block lying immediately north of the building now occupied by the Martin Building—on January 22, 1935.

Born in France, Cret (1876–1945) trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Lyons and Paris before moving to Philadelphia in 1903 to teach architecture at the University of Pennsylvania.

In Washington, D.C., Cret is also known for designing the Organization of American States Building (1908), the Folger Shakespeare Library (1932), and the Calvert Street Bridge (1935, now known as the Duke Ellington Bridge).
