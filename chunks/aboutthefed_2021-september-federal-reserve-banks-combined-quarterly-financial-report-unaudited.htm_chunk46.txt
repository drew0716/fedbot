or loss and net assets between its controlling and non-controlling interest holders. (5) Federal Reserve Notes Federal Reserve notes are the circulating currency of the United States. These notes, which are identified as issued to a specific Reserve Bank, must be fully collateralized. All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized. (6) Depository Institution Deposits Depository institutions' deposits primarily represent the balances in the master accounts and excess balance accounts that depository institutions hold at the Reserve Banks. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances. Effective March 26, 2020, reserve requirements were removed, and all balances held are excess balances. Effective July 29, 2021, the Board of Governors eliminated references to an interest on required reserves rate and to an interest on excess reserves rate and replaced them with a single interest on reserve balances
