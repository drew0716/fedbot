"cryptocurrency" does not cover stock in crypto exchanges or companies engaged in crypto activities. However, section 1(a)(2) of the Policy for Covered Individuals separately prohibits holding bonds issued by individual cryptocurrency companies (or other companies), and section 2(a) prohibits purchasing stocks issued by individual cryptocurrency companies (or other companies). The policy also prohibits holding funds that concentrate in derivatives, including cryptocurrency futures exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"). Q30: How are crypto investment funds treated under the Policy for Covered Individuals? Updated: 2/5/2024 A30: Section 1(a)(1)(iii) prohibits a covered individual (and their spouse and minor child) from holding assets in an investment fund that has a stated policy of concentrating in cryptocurrencies. A crypto investment fund that concentrates in cryptocurrencies would be an impermissible asset. Some examples of crypto investment funds are Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund. Crypto futures funds, such as the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF and the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, are also prohibited investments. X.
