stable financial system. A Federal Committee Setting the Nation's Monetary Policy The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC , is a 12-person group of Federal Reserve System officials that sets crucial U.S. monetary policy at meetings held at least 8 times each year. The FOMC's monetary policy actions influence interest rates and credit conditions, which can significantly impact financial conditions, including economic productivity and even spending and investment decisions by households, communities, and businesses. The FOMC makes all decisions regarding the appropriate position or "stance" of monetary policy to help move the economy toward the congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. The FOMC's 12 voting members include the 7 members of the Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and 4 of the remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. In addition, all the remaining 7 Reserve Bank presidents attend FOMC meetings and participate in FOMC deliberations. The Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee work together to promote the health of the U.S. economy and the stability of the U.S. financial system.
