Describe your engagement with the National Capital Planning Commission to date on the Eccles and 1951 Constitution Avenue building project?
Since the project started, the Board has enjoyed a constructive, collaborative, and fruitful engagement with the NCPC. The Board voluntarily submitted project designs for the Eccles/1951 construction project, and sought and received NCPC approval for designs in both 2020 and 2021. We have welcomed and appreciated the NCPC’s input and worked collaboratively to address the issues they raised. During its September 2, 2021, meeting, NCPC commissioners approved the plans and noted that the Board was highly cooperative with its staff and credited the Board for being responsive to requests and feedback. One commissioner said that the Federal Reserve had been “really put through its paces...and the Federal Reserve deserves a lot of credit.” Another said that it has “been an excellent working relationship.” A third commissioner said that they appreciated the Federal Reserve’s “receptivity and collaboration.”
The Federal Reserve is committed to good stewardship of the public’s resources and has therefore sought feedback and perspectives from a wide range of external groups on its building projects, including the NCPC. Although the Board is not generally subject to the direction of NCPC with respect to its building projects, we voluntarily collaborated with the NCPC and benefitted from robust and collaborative engagement with the commission in earlier stages of this project. The NCPC’s core plan review authorities are advisory only and do not extend to review of project funding.

The NCPC has never exercised a role in overseeing the financial costs of any Federal Reserve projects. Moreover, Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, vested the Board with control of its buildings and both the responsibility and authority to determine all of its expenses and obligations.
