Initial or upgrade work performed during the development phase should be capitalized. Similar work performed during the post-implementation phase should be expensed. Return to table 2. For the conversion to be considered capital, it needs to meet the capitalization criteria in section 5, Improvements to existing software. Return to table A specific software development project may include expenditures for improvements and maintenance that cannot be easily separated. One approach that can be used to separate these costs is a ratio that is based on the projected work hours for development activities for each type of work. Such a ratio can be applied to the development costs to determine the percentage of expenditures that should be capitalized. The basis for allocating costs should be defensible. 6. Replacement of existing software A replacement is a substitution of the existing asset with a new asset. When the results of efforts to rewrite or improve the software are significant enough to be considered a replacement to the existing software and the expenditures meet the criteria in sections 1, 2, and 5, the costs are capitalized. Conversion of an application from a mainframe to a distributed platform is generally considered a replacement. Even though the
