contracts or agreements that delineate ownership, the Reserve Bank that exercises control over the software is the Bank that owns the software. The estimated useful life over which the costs will be amortized should reflect the circumstances for that specific asset. The maximum useful life that should be assigned to a software asset is generally five years. For perpetual license agreements, the deferred charge should be amortized over a reasonable period generally, not to exceed five years, based on the type and use of the software. In unusual situations, a request to establish a longer useful life must be submitted for RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section staff approval. At a minimum, each Bank should assess the useful lives of software assets annually. Capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement that does not contain a software license should be amortized over the non-cancellable term of the hosting arrangement and any optional renewal periods reasonably certain to be exercised. Categorization of some software development or capitalization of implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements may not be as easily determined from the above guidance and may require more analysis with the product or support office, business area, and review by
