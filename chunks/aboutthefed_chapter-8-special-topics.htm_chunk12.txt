the factors can be verified objectively. If the Bank estimates a range for either the amount or timing of possible cash flows, the likelihood of the possible outcomes shall be considered in determining the best estimate of expected future cash flows. Other considerations may exist such as loan-specific credit protection in the form of a guarantee or credit insurance feature. 1 In the case of a non-derivative credit enhancement that is separable from the loan such that its benefits do not follow with or are extinguished with the loan, any expected recoveries from credit enhancements cannot be used to offset the recorded amount of the allowance for credit loss for the impaired loan. If the credit enhancement is attached to the loan, such that it always follows the loan upon its sale, the proceeds of such enhancements may be considered in the loss estimation. The Bank should consider potential recovery from third-party guarantors such as FDIC, other government agencies, or bond insurance. Additional recourse to consider is the ability to debit the borrower's account with the Federal Reserve. The Bank should consider all the cash flows associated with the loan and its specific credit protections when measuring the incurred loss
