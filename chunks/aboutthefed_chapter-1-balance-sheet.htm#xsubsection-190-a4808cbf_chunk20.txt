Acceptances arise out of the shipment of goods between countries or within the United States or from the storage of goods within the United States pending marketing. All holdings of acceptances are retained on the FRBNY's balance sheet and are not participated to other Reserve Banks. When acceptances are purchased or sold, the net amount of the transaction is paid to or collected by the FRBNY from the dealer. Only the par value of this transaction is entered to this account. Other accounts that may be affected are interest accrued, premium on securities, discount on securities and, in the case of sales, profit and loss. The FRBNY has not engaged in transactions involving acceptances for several years. 2.75 Securities Held Under Repurchase Agreements (140-075) The FRBNY is authorized by the FOMC to acquire Treasury, federal agency
