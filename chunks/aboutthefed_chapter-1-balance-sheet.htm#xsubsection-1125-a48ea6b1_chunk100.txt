weekly for H.4.1. statutory reporting purposes. On each Wednesday, if accruals are made weekly, or on each day, the difference between total estimated net operating expenses and total net operating expenses recorded for the week or day should be debited (or credited) to the Expenses accrued—estimated subaccount included in an operating expense account (330-050) and credited (or debited) to accrued expenses unpaid—estimated (240-200) included in other liabilities. After these entries are made, the balances in these two accounts will represent the difference between estimated net operating expenses for the month-to-date and total net operating expenses for the month-to-date as recorded. On the Form FR 34, the debit balance in the "Expenses accrued-estimated" account should be included in the "Operating expenses" account (330-050) and the credit balance in the "Accrued expenses unpaid—estimated" account (240-200) should be reported under the caption "Other liabilities." If month-to-date net operating expenses recorded exceeds total estimated net operating expenses, resulting in a credit balance in "Expenses accrued-estimated" and a debit balance in "Accrued expenses unpaid-estimated," these two accounts should be adjusted to zero. On the last day of the month, these accounts should be closed against each other. Accrual of Expense/Expenditure at Month-End and Year-End Expenses
