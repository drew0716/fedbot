Bank for software development efforts. Costs incurred during the development stage related to general and administrative expense and end-user testing and training should be expensed. Post-implementation stage costs generally should be expensed, except the cost of prepaid maintenance contracts, provided that the costs meet the FAM thresholds for prepaid assets or deferred charges. Other non-capitalizable costs include process re-engineering costs, data conversion costs, and training costs. When internal use software is purchased and the purchase price includes non-capitalizable items (e.g., training), the price must be allocated among capitalizable and non-capitalizable items based on fair value. The costs for website development are accounted for in the same manner as costs of internal use software. Expenditures made to change existing software assets are considered either improvements or maintenance. Expenditures to existing software assets that meet the capitalization thresholds discussed above should be capitalized if the improvement provides additional capabilities and meets one of the following criteria: The quantity of output or operating efficiency of the asset is significantly increased. The quality of output is significantly increased. Improvements should be recorded as separate assets with unique useful lives determined in accordance with the discussion of useful lives below.
