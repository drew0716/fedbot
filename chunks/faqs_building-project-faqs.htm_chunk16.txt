What is the history of the buildings and what challenges are posed by renovating historic buildings?
The Eccles Building was constructed between 1935 and 1937 as the headquarters for the Federal Reserve Board. The 1951 Constitution Avenue Building was constructed in 1932 for the U.S. Public Health Service, and over its history, housed a variety of government agencies, including the Combined Chiefs of Staff during World War II, the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of the Interior. Both buildings are listed in the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites, and the 1951 Constitution Avenue Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The construction project identified key architectural features to preserve the historic integrity of the buildings, such as stonework, including marble, façades, meeting rooms, and other spaces. Historic preservation work in the Eccles Building also includes elevators that are original to the building, and historic conference rooms.
Construction involving the preservation of historic spaces requires specialized processes and methods, which are generally more complex and have increased costs compared with new construction or renovation of spaces that are not historically significant or located on the National Mall.
