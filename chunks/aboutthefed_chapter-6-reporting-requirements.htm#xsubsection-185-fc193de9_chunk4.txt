The Reserve Banks are still required to maintain records suitable to provide ad hoc reports to the Board; however, the submission of an annual Form FR 1425 is no longer required. Summary Information should be captured as follows: Total Contract Awards —All contracts awarded and commitment dollars for the year, except for those awarded for personal services. The full liability of all purchase orders and contracts should be reported in the year in which they are executed, including the liability associated with all years of a multi-year contract. For any blanket or retainer type contracts that have an "open-ended" or "not-to-be-exceeded" dollar value, actual expenditures rather than commitment dollars should be reported. Small Business Awards —Contract awards, commitment dollars, and purchase orders to firms qualifying as a small business concern under the Small Business Act of 1953, as amended. Further, "small business" means a small business concern under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. Section 632) and the regulation promulgated thereto defining size standards for government procurement purposes, by SIC industry (13 CFR Section 121.601 et seq.).

African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Pacific Americans are among those considered socially disadvantaged. Women-owned businesses should not be reported in this category unless they are a small disadvantaged business as defined above. Supplemental Information should be captured as follows, if applicable.
