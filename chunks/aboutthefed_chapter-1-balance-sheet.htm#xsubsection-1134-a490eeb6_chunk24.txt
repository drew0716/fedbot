securities must be either direct obligations of the United States, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities are also recorded in this account, the amounts of which are adjusted for inflation compensation. When securities are purchased or sold, the net amount of the transaction is paid to or collected by the FRBNY from the dealer and only the par value is entered to this account. Other accounts that may be affected are interest accrued, premium on securities, discount on securities and, in the case of sales, profit and loss. The amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts is discussed in paragraphs 4.00 and 11.52 , respectively. The securities are accounted for at amortized cost rather than fair value; therefore, no unrealized gains or losses are recognized. On the day of settlement the FRBNY participates a share of the transaction to each Reserve Bank. Related interest income and gains and losses are participated to each Bank according to its current domestic allocation rate.
