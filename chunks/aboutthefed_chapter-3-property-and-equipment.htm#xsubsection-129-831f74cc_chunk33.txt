renovation. However, if floor renovations are rare, or no particular trend emerges in the frequency of the renovation, a Reserve Bank may consider assigning the remaining useful life of the building as the useful life of its current renovation. Improvements that replace assets with a separately distinguishable book value should be treated as a replacement (see replacement requirements below). See paragraphs 30.85â€“30.87 for the appropriate treatment of leasehold and tenant improvements. The accounting for costs associated with improvements made to computer equipment should be capitalized if the improvement meets the $10,000 capitalization threshold of individual assets and the improvements are tangible. To illustrate, assume that a two-year old computer is initially purchased for $l,000,000 and the expected useful life is set at six years. At the end of four years, an improvement is made for $300,000 which is considered tangible and is expected to extend the useful life two years beyond the original useful life period (four years from the time of the improvement) and increase the salvage value $30,000. Initially, the computer was being depreciated at $150,000 per year to a salvage value of $100,000. After the improvement, it would be depreciated at $142,500 per year to a salvage
