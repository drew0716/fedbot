FR 892 should reach the RBOPS Building Planning Section by January 20 or the next business day of the year following the reporting period. In addition, a report should be submitted whenever a change occurs in a lease or rental agreement including identifying new and/or terminated leases. The reporting form is designed to accommodate information concerning several leases or rental agreements. In submitting the data, each lease or agreement should be shown on a separate line of the report. If an office is both leasing Bank-owned property to outside tenants and leasing non-Bank-owned property for Bank use, separate reports should be submitted covering each type of transaction, rather than combining them on the same report.
