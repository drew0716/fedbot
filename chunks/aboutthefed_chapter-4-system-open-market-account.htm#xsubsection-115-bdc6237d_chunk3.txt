foreign government debt instruments are adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on an effective interest method. Both the domestic and foreign components of the SOMA portfolio may involve transactions that result in gains or losses when holdings are sold prior to maturity. Decisions regarding securities and foreign currency transactions, including their purchase and sale, are motivated by monetary policy and financial stability objectives rather than profit. Accordingly, market values, earnings, and any gains or losses resulting from the sale of such securities and currencies are incidental to the open market operations and do not motivate decisions related to policy or open market activities. The Reserve Banks do not present a statement of cash flows because their liquidity and cash position do not affect their ability to meet their financial obligations and responsibilities. The financial statement footnote disclosures, however, include cash flow information for significant categories of Reserve Bank activities, such as open market operations, lending, and capital expenditures. Profit motivated entities provide a cash flow statement to disclose their ability to generate future cash flows and thus the ability to meet their obligations. This does not represent a risk to the Reserve Banks. 40.10 U.S. Treasury, Federal
