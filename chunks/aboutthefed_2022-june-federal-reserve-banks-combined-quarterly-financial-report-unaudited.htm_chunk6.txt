Return to table (3) Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) The Board of Governors authorized several lending facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. The combined financial statements include the accounts and result of operations of the consolidated VIEs formed to administer certain lending facilities. A Reserve Bank consolidates a VIE if it has a controlling financial interest. The Reserve Banks that are controlling members have extended loans to the VIEs under the authority of section 13(3) of the FRA. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the Treasury provided credit protection to the limited liability companies (LLCs) and has a non-controlling interest in MS Facilities LLC (Main Street), Municipal Liquidity Facility LLC (MLF), Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility II LLC (TALF II), and Corporate Credit Facilities LLC (CCF). The Treasury, using the Exchange Stabilization Fund, made an equity investment in CP Funding Facility II LLC (CPFF II). The assets of the VIE and the amounts provided by the Treasury as credit protection are used to secure the loan from the Reserve Banks. Main Street supported small and medium sized businesses, and nonprofit organizations in sound financial condition before the onset of the pandemic through the purchase of loan participations. MLF purchased municipal notes to support lending to state, city, and county governments, certain multistate entities, and other issuers of municipal securities. TALF II supported the flow of credit to consumers and businesses by enabling issuance of asset-backed securities which were backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the SBA, and certain other assets. CPFF II supported the flow of credit to households and business through US dollar-denominated commercial paper issuances which supplied credit and funding for auto loans, mortgages, and liquidity to meet operational needs of a range of companies. CCF provided liquidity to employers by purchasing original corporate bond and loans issuances, and outstanding corporate bonds and exchange traded funds. The authority for MLF and TALF II to purchase assets ended December 31, 2020, and Main Street's authority to purchase assets ended on January 8, 2021. During 2022 and 2021, Main Street, MLF, and TALF II returned portions of the Treasury's equity investment, as reported in table 14a and 14b, respectively. The authority for CPFF II and CCF to purchase assets ended December 31, 2020, and March 31, 2021, respectively. Prior to the termination of CCF and CPFF II, where all obligations of the facilities were repaid, the remaining assets were distributed to the FRBNY and Treasury, as reported in table 14b. The classification of assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, are as follows: Table 12a.
