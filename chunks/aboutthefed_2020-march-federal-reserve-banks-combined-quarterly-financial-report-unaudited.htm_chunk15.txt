maturity in table 6 above. The estimated weighted-average lives of the federal agency and GSE RMBS and CMBS differ from the stated maturity in table 6 primarily because these estimated weighted-average lives factor in scheduled payments and prepayment assumptions. The estimated weighted-average life of federal agency and GSE RMBS was approximately 3.6 years and 5.3 years as of March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the federal agency and GSE CMBS was approximately 8.5 years as of March 31, 2020. Information about transactions related to Treasury securities, federal agency and GSE MBS, and GSE debt securities held in the SOMA during the three months ended March 31, 2020, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, is summarized as follows: Table 7a.
