one of the following criteria: The quantity of output or operating efficiency of the asset is significantly increased. The quality of output is significantly increased. Improvements should be recorded as separate assets with unique useful lives determined in accordance with the discussion of useful lives below. When the results of efforts to rewrite or improve the software are significant enough to be considered a replacement to the existing software and the expenditures meet the capitalization criteria, the costs should be capitalized. Because the former software asset is significantly altered, the net book value of the former software asset is expensed. The costs of shared capitalized software projects (i.e., software developed by more than one Reserve Bank) should be transferred to the books of the Reserve Bank that owns the software. The Bank that owns the software should account for the entire software asset, including related amortization and disposal costs. Absent contracts or agreements that delineate ownership, the Reserve Bank that exercises control over the software is the Bank that owns the software. The estimated useful life over which the costs will be amortized should reflect the circumstances for that specific asset. The maximum useful life that should be assigned to
