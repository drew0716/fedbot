the criteria specified in FASB ASC Topic 810-10 for Voting Interest Entity Model and the Variable Interest Entity Model. Two different assessments are provided because a controlling financial interest may be achieved other than by ownership of shares or voting interests. The voting interest entity model Under the voting interest entity model for legal entities other than limited partnerships, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity. The variable interest entity (VIE) model Under the VIE model, a controlling financial interest requires both of the following: The power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and The obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. A reporting entity with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary. The reporting entity could be, but is not limited to being, an equity investor and another capital provider such as a debt holder, or a party with another contractual arrangement such as a guarantor. 82.02 Evaluating Consolidation
