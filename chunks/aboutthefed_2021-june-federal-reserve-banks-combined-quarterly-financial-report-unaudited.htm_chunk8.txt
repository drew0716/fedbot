and MLF are subject to review each reporting period to identify indications of other-than-temporary impairment, and no impairments were indicated as of June 30, 2021. TALF II loans and Main Street loan participations are evaluated for impairment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 310-10. No impairments were indicated for loans and there were no loans in non-accrual status extended by TALF II as of June 30, 2021. Main Street's allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances for impaired loan participations and a general allowance for all other loan participations and collectively reflects management's estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reporting date. The principal exposure of loan participations in non-accrual status as of June 30, 2021, was $3,018 million. The evaluation of loan participations, including those in non-accrual status, resulted in recording a loan loss allowance of $2,545 million as of June 30, 2021.
