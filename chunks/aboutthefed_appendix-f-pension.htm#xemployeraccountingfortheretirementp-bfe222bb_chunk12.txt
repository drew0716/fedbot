segregated or restricted on a subsidiary-by-subsidiary basis. If a subsidiary withdraws from the plan, the benefit obligations for its employees are retained by the parent's plan (as opposed to being allocated to the withdrawing subsidiary). The participating subsidiary would not recognize an allocation of the plan's funded status (only the plan sponsor should recognize the plan's funded status on its balance sheet). If a subsidiary doesn't meet the above criteria, it should not follow multi-employer plan accounting. The parent (or the ultimate plan sponsor) should account for the plan as a single-employer defined benefit plan in its consolidated financial statements per ASC 715-30-55-64. In applying this guidance, the subsidiaries would be the 11 Reserve Banks who are not reporting the funded status, while the Reserve Bank who does report the funded status would be considered the parent or the ultimate plan sponsor. While there is no ‘parent' or ‘subsidiary' entity within the Federal Reserve System, as noted earlier, the FRBA will now be primarily responsible for development of the OEB's operational strategies, operational performance and delivery, provider of shared services, leadership support, and coordination of benefits governance.
