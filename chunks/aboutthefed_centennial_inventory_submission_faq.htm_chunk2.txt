this a Federal Reserve System initiative? Commemoration of the Federal Reserve centennial will occur at a System level, and each Federal Reserve Bank will also commemorate at a local level. What events and activities is the Federal Reserve planning to commemorate the centennial? While our planning efforts are still under way, we have committed to creating an inventory of Federal Reserve historical material and intend to highlight the centennial at existing annual Federal Reserve System Research conferences. We also plan to create a short video on the Federal Reserve. More specific public communications about the centennial will be provided as details are finalized. What is the inventory of Federal Reserve historical documents? The inventory is the first project undertaken as a part of preparing for the upcoming centennial. The inventory is a list of historical records, documents, and other materials related to the Federal Reserve System and its leaders, including information about the size and location of the historical collections. Is everything on the list available digitally? Not at this time; however, many items in the inventory are digitized, and information about web availability is included.
