estimating and evaluating an impairment loss with the benefits, impairments should only be pursued if the carrying value exceeds recovery amount by the following thresholds. 17 For those assets that are grouped, the thresholds apply to the group. These measurements, and those in the remaining steps, should be made as of the date the impairment was probable and estimable. Land: $500,000 Buildings: Larger of $500,000 or $50,000 x the remaining useful life of the building Specialized Improvements: $100,000 Equipment: $50,000 Software: $50,000 Asset Fair Value and Impairment Loss Based on the Difference between Carrying Value and Fair Value The fair value of the asset (group) is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current arms-length transaction. The ideal method for determining fair value is to use the price for the asset if it is traded in an active market. The next best method is to base fair value on the prices for similar assets (appraisal). The remaining method is to use the discounted present value of the expected cash flows for the asset. In general, assumptions and techniques used to determine fair value should be the same that marketplace participants would use if the
