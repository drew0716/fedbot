Is there a VIP elevator?
No. The original elevators are being rehabilitated, including an elevator that services historic conference rooms that are also used for mealtime meetings. A short extension of this rehabilitated elevator will make the space more accessible for people with disabilities. There are no elevators where access is limited to governors.
