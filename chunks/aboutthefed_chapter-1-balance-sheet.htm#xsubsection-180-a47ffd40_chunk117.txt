risk of loss due to shortfalls between claims and premiums. The liability reflected should be an estimate of the actual amounts of claims incurred but not paid. In order to maintain consistency among Reserve Bank estimates, a standard approach to this estimate has been adopted. The year-end liability should be based on the prior years' experience adjusted for current trends in claims. To establish a "subsequent claims ratio," determine the amount of claims paid in the current year that were incurred in the prior year (run-out claims) and divide this amount by the total claims paid in the prior year. This ratio should then be applied to the most recent 12 months of payments data available to obtain the amount of the liability. For the consolidated plans, OEB will make this estimate on a Systemwide basis and allocate differences based on each Bank's funding rate. Exceptional circumstances (e.g., a change in claims administrator or plan design changes) may exist that would lead to a material misstatement of this liability if additional adjustments were not made. In such situations, the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section should be contacted for approval of an appropriate alternative estimation methodology. Special Considerations: Remember
