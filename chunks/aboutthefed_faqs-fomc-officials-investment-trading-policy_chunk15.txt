retains legal control over the investment is considered a gift under the Policy for Covered Individuals. Q85: May a covered individual use a corporate entity, such as a special purpose LLC, to engage in permissible investments? Updated: 2/5/2024 A85: Yes, however, the Policy for Covered Individuals applies to all investments owned or controlled by a covered individual or their spouse. Thus, Ethics officials generally will apply a look-through approach to investments made by corporate entities controlled by covered individuals or their spouses. Accordingly, if a covered individual or their spouse exercises control over a corporate entity, then they generally will be deemed to control the corporate entityâs investments, and those investments would be subject to the policy. Q86: Are covered individuals eligible to obtain certificates of divestiture ("CDs")? Updated: 4/15/2022 A86: Board employees are eligible to request a CD from OGE prior to selling investment assets that they must divest to comply with federal ethics requirements. If OGE grants the request and the Board employee receives a CD, they may defer capital gains taxes resulting from the sales if the proceeds are promptly reinvested in diversified mutual funds or diversified ETFs. However, under federal law, Reserve Bank employees are not eligible for CDs. Q87: What will happen if covered individuals violate the Policy for Covered Individuals, such as by failing to execute a pre-cleared trade? Updated: 2/5/2024 A87: The consequences of any particular instance of noncompliance with the policy will depend on a number of factors, such as the severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional or inadvertent, and whether the violation was a first or repeat offense. Q88: How does the Policy for Covered Individuals apply to automatic stock buybacks that occur as the result of a corporate acquisition? Updated: 2/5/2024 A88: The policyâs advance notice, pre-clearance, and trading blackout requirements apply to securities transactions that are controlled by or subject to the control of a covered individual or their spouse or minor child. Unlike trades of securities that are held within a managed account or trust account that are controlled by a covered individual or their spouse or minor child, stock buybacks typically are not subject to such control, and occur automatically upon a corporate acquisition. Therefore, unless a covered individual or their spouse or minor child controls the corporate acquisition, an automatic stock buyback is not subject to the policyâs advance notice and pre-clearance requirements or the trading blackout restrictions.
