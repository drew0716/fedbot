Return to table Federal agency and GSE residential MBS (RMBS) and commercial MBS (CMBS) are reported at stated maturity in table 7 above. The estimated weighted-average lives of the federal agency and GSE RMBS and CMBS differ from the stated maturity in table 7 primarily because these estimated weighted-average lives factor in scheduled payments and prepayment assumptions. The estimated weighted-average life of federal agency and GSE RMBS was approximately 3.4 years and 5.3 years as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the federal agency and GSE CMBS was approximately 9.1 years as of September 30, 2020.
