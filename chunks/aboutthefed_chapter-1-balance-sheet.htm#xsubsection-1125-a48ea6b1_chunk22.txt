(See paragraph 40.70 for the participation methodology.) 2.80 Federal Agency Obligations: Bought Outright and Held Under Repurchase Agreement (140-100 and 140-125) The FRBNY is authorized by the FOMC to purchase and sell federal agency obligations for the System Open Market Account (SOMA). This account includes federal agency and GSE securities. The securities are bought from or sold to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the FRBNY at market prices. By law, the securities must be either direct obligations of an agency of the United States, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by such agency. When these securities are purchased or sold, the net amount of the transaction is paid to or collected by the FRBNY from the dealer and only the par value is entered to this account. Other accounts that may be affected are interest accrued, premium on securities, discount on securities and, in the case of sales, profit and loss. The amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts is discussed in paragraphs 4.00 and 11.52 , respectively. The securities are accounted for at amortized cost rather than fair value; therefore, no unrealized gains or losses
