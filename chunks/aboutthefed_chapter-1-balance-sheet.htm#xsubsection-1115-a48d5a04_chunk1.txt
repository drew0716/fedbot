Balance Sheet 1.00 General The balance sheet, form FR 34 , shows in detail the assets, liabilities, and capital accounts of the Federal Reserve Banks and certain additional information such as U.S. Government deposits with special depositaries, collateral and custodies held, classifications of "Other deposits—Miscellaneous," and certain memorandum accounts. The Federal Reserve Act (11(a)(1)) requires the Board to publish a weekly statement of the condition of each Reserve Bank and a consolidated statement for all Reserve Banks, reflecting assets and liabilities, money held as a reserve, and details of investments owned or held by the Reserve Banks. The Board publishes the Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks (H.4.1), weekly pursuant to this requirement. 1 The H.4.1 also furnishes the Board of Governors with basic, original source material for statistical data, much of which is published, relating to the condition of Federal Reserve Banks. Additional periodic Federal Reserve Bank reporting is included in chapter 6 . Each Reserve Bank should set up such general ledger and subsidiary accounts as it requires for its own purposes to prepare the balance sheet and to maintain satisfactory internal controls. This chapter provides general descriptions of the scope of the balance sheet accounts to promote uniformity of accounting treatment. It is not the intent of this manual to redefine basic accounting principles. In those cases where the accounting treatment is unclear, Reserve Banks should contact the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section for a FAM interpretation. Transactions of the Reserve Bank must be recorded in the general ledger and reflected on the Balance Sheet; none of the principles or possible lack of specific instructions for any given transaction in this manual should be interpreted as allowing otherwise. Proper accounting practice requires consistent application of accounting principles throughout the District (i.e., head office and Branches) from year to year. If this manual permits Reserve Banks to choose optional treatment for transactions, Reserve Banks should consistently apply the chosen option to all similar transactions. In general, the provisions of this manual address Reserve Bank accounting issues and should be applied from a District perspective (for example, the process for accruals required by paragraph 11.56 should be applied on a Districtwide basis rather than department or Branch basis).
