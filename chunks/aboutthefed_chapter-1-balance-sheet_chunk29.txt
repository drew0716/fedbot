At the time entries are made to the reimbursable account, an estimate is made of the amount of the claim that is not expected to be received. The offsetting account would be the contra-asset account, Allowance for Doubtful Reimbursement or Reimbursable expenses for direct write-offs. Near the end of each year, adjusting entries may be required in order for the balance in this account to equal the cost of services provided to Treasury during the year for which Treasury has informed the Federal Reserve reimbursement will not be made or which the Federal Reserve has determined is unlikely. This account should be closed out at the end of each year. Costs in this account should be generated primarily from District or special projects that have not been approved by the Bureau of Public Debt or the Financial Management Service of Treasury.

The Richmond Reserve Bank processes an InterFRB transaction for each Reserve Bank's portion of the assessment with a debit to this account and a credit to the Interdistrict Settlement account. The Board is also authorized to leave on deposit in the Reserve Banks the proceeds of such assessments. Pursuant to this authority, the Board maintains deposit accounts with the Richmond Reserve Bank and at the time of each assessment requests credit for one-half of the amount to its General Fund deposit account at Richmond. The remaining half is called on the first business day in April and October. F.R.

The Board assesses the Reserve Banks, on a scheduled basis, for currency printing, shipping, issuance, retirement, educational services, research and development, and counterfeit deterrence costs. The costs are allocated based on each Bank's share of the total number of Federal Reserve notes outstanding at all Reserve Banks on December 31st of the previous year. Reserve Banks should debit this account upon payment of these costs. Separate accounts should be maintained for (l) cost of printing, (2) cost of shipping (including the periodic assessment for bags and seals), (3) retirement costs, and (4) research and development costs for F.R. currency, see appendix A.3 . 12.46 Assessments by Board of GovernorsâBureau of Consumer Financial Protection (330-135) This account is used to record the Board of Governors' assessments to the Reserve Banks.
