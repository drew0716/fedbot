Do changes that the Board has made to its original project designs approved by NCPC warrant further review by NCPC?
As noted above, the Board generally is not subject to direction from the NCPC on its building projects. We note, however, that even if the Board were subject to NCPC direction, guidance from the NCPC states that covered agencies should submit revised project information for covered projects only if
substantial changes
are made in either the design or plan of the project after NCPC review. Beginning in 2023, the Board made a small number of design changes to remove certain elements and added no new elements. These changes were intended to simplify and hasten the remaining construction, decrease complexity, and reduce the possibility of further cost overruns and delays. The Federal Reserve does not regard any of those changes as warranting further review. We are committed to continuing our work as a responsible agency in the federal government and a good citizen in Washington, D.C.
