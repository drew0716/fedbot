(4) Federal Reserve Notes Federal Reserve notes are the circulating currency of the United States. These notes, which are identified as issued to a specific Reserve Bank, must be fully collateralized. All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized. (5) Depository Institution Deposits Depository institution deposits primarily represent required reserve balances and excess reserve balances. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances. (6) Treasury Deposits The Treasury holds deposits at the Reserve Banks in a general account pursuant the Reserve Banks' role as fiscal agent and depositary of the United States. (7) Capital and Surplus The Federal Reserve Act (FRA) requires that each member bank subscribe to the capital stock of the Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 percent of the capital and surplus of the member bank. These shares are nonvoting, with a par value of $100, and may not be transferred or hypothecated. As a member bank's capital and surplus changes, its holdings of Reserve Bank stock must be adjusted. Currently, only one-half of the subscription is paid in, and the remainder is subject to call. A member bank is liable for Reserve Bank liabilities up to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it. The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semiannually and is cumulative. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Budget Act), which was enacted on February 9, 2018, amended section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act related to Reserve Bank surplus. The Budget Act reduced the statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus from $10.0 billion to $7.5 billion, which required the Reserve Banks to make a lump sum payment to the Treasury in the amount of $2.5 billion. This lump sum payment is reported as a component of "Earnings remittances to the Treasury" in the Combined statements of operations. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Economic Growth Act), which was enacted on May 24, 2018, amended section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act related to Reserve Bank surplus. The Economic Growth Act reduced the statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus from $7.5 billion to $6.825 billion, which required the Reserve Banks to make a lump sum payment to the Treasury in the amount of $675 million.
