staff approval. 12. Impairment and write-off of software development costs or software assets Significant events or changes in operating circumstances warrant a review to determine whether the carrying value of an existing software asset or capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement that does not contain a software license is not recoverable and should be impaired. Tests should be performed consistent with FAM, Chapter 3, section 30.95 (Asset Impairment) and Board staff should be contacted for approval. In the case of software applications developed for Treasury, no impairment typically results because all costs including those associated with software are generally recoverable from the Treasury. The need for a change in estimated useful life, however, should be considered. Impairment is applicable, for example, when one of the following events or changes in circumstances occurs related to the software being developed or currently in use indicating that the carrying amount may not be recoverable according to ASC Topic 350-40: Internal-use computer software or the cloud computing arrangement is not expected to provide substantive service potential. A significant change occurs in the extent or manner in which the software or the cloud computing arrangement is used or is expected to be used.
