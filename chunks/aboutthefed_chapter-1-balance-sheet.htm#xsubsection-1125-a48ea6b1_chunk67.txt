There is no objection to the Reserve Banks' using the currency and coin received in the ordinary course of business to fill out their exhibits, or to their purchasing individual items from dealers or others for this purpose. It is inappropriate for the Reserve Banks to bid on miscellaneous collections of currency and coin offered for sale by executors of estates or others, and also inappropriate for them to trade or sell currency and coin to collectors and dealers.
