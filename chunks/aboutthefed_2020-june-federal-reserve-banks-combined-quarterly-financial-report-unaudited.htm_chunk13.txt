Reserve Banks offer primary, secondary, and seasonal loans to eligible borrowers (depository institutions that maintain reservable transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits and have established discount window borrowing privileges). Primary and secondary loans are extended on a short-term basis, typically overnight, whereas seasonal loans may be extended for a period of up to nine months. Other Loans, Net MMLF, PPPLF, and PDCF were established pursuant to section 13(3) of the FRA (note 1). The Treasury contributed $1.5 billion as credit protection for the MMLF, which is reported on the Combined statements of condition as "Treasury credit protection provided for lending facility." The PPPLF program extends credit to eligible financial institutions that originate Paycheck Protection Program loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value.
