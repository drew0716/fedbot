5 years, until 2007. In 2004, the useful life was extended an additional 10 years, until 2017. In 2012, the useful life was extended an additional 5 years, until 2022. The machines were originally thought to have a 30-year useful life, but the original 10-year life was based on the collective anticipated life of the System's information technology, data architecture, and computer components. Over time, the machines have continued to operate with new sensors and extended maintenance agreements. The current sensors have useful lives through 2022. Sensors have the capability to authenticate the current currency's design, and up to one additional currency design. The CTO extended the maintenance agreements through 2022 with the maintenance provider, which is confident of the viability of the technology over the extended period. Per FAM paragraph 30.76 , the change in estimate shall be accounted for prospectively such that the remaining net book value is depreciated over the expected remaining useful life of the asset. This extension applies to the BPS 3000 CP and RS and all production sensors. This change in estimate, however, does not affect the accounting for spare sensors because spare sensors are recorded as hardware assets, as of January 1, 2021,
