In the event that it would be needed, detailed instructions on how to recognize, measure, and record an allowance for credit loss are provided in paragraph 81.01 , Allowance for Credit Losses. The Reserve Banks should use account 330-080 to record the expense provision. The provision for credit loss expense recorded in this account must be approved by the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section. 12.40 Profit and Loss (330-100) This account is used for recording income and losses which are not current in nature or are not applicable to current earnings or current expenses. These include realized gains and losses on sales of securities and on foreign currencies, profit or loss on the sale of real estate (originally acquired for potential Bank use), the write-off of stale officers' and certified checks ( paragraph 10.80 ), losses that are sustained in the handling or transportation of currency, recoveries and unrealized losses on the value of other real estate (originally acquired for potential Bank use) held for sale, and gains or losses on works of art. The account should not normally be used to adjust prior year income or expenses except for the correction of prior year accounting errors when the amount would seriously distort income or expenses of the current year. Entries to the account for prior year items may be made only with the prior approval of the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section. The profit and loss account should not include dividends and rebates on insurance policies or any additional premium payments on worker's compensation or other insurance regardless of the year for which the refunds or additional payments apply. Such amounts should be entered to current year income or expenses. Other items from the previous year, which should normally be applied to current year income or expenses rather than profit and loss, are receipts from vending machines, refunds from courier contracts, adjustments for the difference between accounts payable and the actual billings, and adjustments for the difference between accrued income from services and actual billings. The profit and loss account should also exclude losses arising from the ongoing operations of the Reserve Banks. Any such losses should be charged to current expense. The balance represents the net total of miscellaneous entries, such as the following: Profit (loss) on sale of Bank premise assets or other real estate —The difference between net book value and the proceeds from the sale of Bank premises assets and other real estate (formerly used in bank operations).

(See 30.97 . ) Profit (loss) on sale of "Other assets—claims account closed banks" —Book profit or loss resulting from the sale (or other final disposal) of "Other assets—claims account closed banks." When an allowance for estimated losses on such property is carried, the entire difference between gross carrying value of the particular asset and the proceeds received, if disposition results in a loss, may be charged to the allowance unless such a charge would result in a debit balance therein, in which case the excess should be charged to Profit and loss. If disposition results in a profit, the excess should be credited to Profit and loss. Losses (not expected to be recovered) on shipments of money Recoveries of losses on shipments of money Other recoveries —Other recoveries of amounts previously charged to profit and loss, such as recoveries of unclaimed funds.
