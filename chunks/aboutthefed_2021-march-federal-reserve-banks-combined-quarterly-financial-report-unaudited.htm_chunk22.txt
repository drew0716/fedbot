GSE residential MBS (RMBS) and commercial MBS (CMBS) are reported at stated maturity in Table 7 above. The estimated weighted-average lives of these securities differ from the stated maturity in Table 7 primarily because these estimated weighted-average lives factor in scheduled payments and prepayment assumptions. The estimated weighted-average life of RMBS was approximately 5.1 years and 3.1 years as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of CMBS was approximately 8.7 years and 8.8 years as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.
