of nearly $373.6 million. Under the circumstances, the Board concluded that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve Banks to pay to Treasury the bulk of their net earnings after providing for necessary expenses and the statutory dividend. In effect, this involved paying currently to Treasury funds which, under existing law, would otherwise come to it only in the event of liquidation of the Federal Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve Act still provides that, in case of liquidation of the Federal Reserve Banks, any surplus remaining after the payment of all claims shall be paid to Treasury. By invoking its authority under Section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Board was able to accomplish the same results as were accomplished by the payments of franchise tax, i.e., the transfer of excess earnings to the Government. Effective December 4, 2015, the Federal Reserve Act was amended to limit the Reserve Banks' aggregate surplus funds to $10 billion. Effective February 9, 2018, the Federal Reserve Act was amended to limit the Reserve Banks aggregate surplus funds to $7.5 billion. Effective May 24, 2018, the Federal Reserve Act was amended to limit the Reserve Banks aggregate surplus funds to $6.825 billion.
