Why is a renovation needed of Federal Reserve buildings?
Major systems in both buildings were obsolete and in need of replacement for health and safety reasons. They included plumbing, electrical, fire suppression, water connections, and HVAC. Some systems dated to the construction of the buildings in the 1930s.
The project also remediates safety issues by removing hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead and will bring the buildings up to modern code. While periodic work has been done to keep the buildings occupiable, neither building has seen a comprehensive renovation since they were constructed.
Interior spaces are also being made more accessible for people with disabilities, including providing step-free access to main lobbies and a short extension of an original elevator to eliminate the need for a ramp to access historic conference rooms.
