Were changes made to the project?
Yes. Some features on the buildings, including rooftop spaces and new water features on the building grounds, were scaled back or eliminated as the project moved forward. In addition, in light of higher-than-expected construction costs, the Board in 2024 canceled a separate planned renovation of its New York Avenue Building.
