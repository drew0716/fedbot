Payments on Impaired Loans Two accounting practices exist for recording cash payments that are periodically received on the impaired loans: the cash basis method and the modified cost recovery method. The Banks should apply the modified cost recovery method to recover the investment in the loan prior to recognizing interest income, unless contract terms specify treatment. This method is more conservative because it defers income recognition until the principal is recovered. Cash Basis Method Under the cash basis method, payments of interest received are recorded as interest income provided the amount does not exceed that which would have been earned at the historical effective interest rate. Modified Cost Recovery Method Under the modified cost recovery method, any interest or principal received is recorded as a direct reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. When the recorded investment has been fully collected, any additional amounts collected are recognized as interest income. This method may result in the recorded investment being less than the present value of the loan because the recorded investment excludes interest income and the present value includes interest. 81.06 Valuation Allowance Adjustments For impairment models leveraging the present value of future cash flow approach, at the end
