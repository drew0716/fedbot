even if the net book value of the asset is zero. (See paragraph 30.95 .) Appropriate subsidiary records, reflecting the original acquisition cost, the cost of any improvements, and allowance for depreciation balance should be maintained in all cases. Land, artwork, and assets held for sale or future use are not depreciated. 30.76 Depreciation Rate and Salvage Value Table 30.78 provides information for establishing useful lives and salvage values for the types of assets described within this chapter. Similar assets, within an asset category, that have the same useful lives may be grouped for depreciation purposes, as long as memorandum records are maintained detailing the original charges to the account by piece of equipment. It should be noted that Table 30.78 provides parameters within which the Reserve Bank may determine the appropriate depreciation schedule for assets. It should not be viewed as an indication of rates that are automatically to be assigned to new or used equipment. If a Reserve Bank has a special case where the documented useful life or salvage value of an asset exceeds the guidelines set forth, a request, with substantiating documentation, should be sent to the Manager of the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting
