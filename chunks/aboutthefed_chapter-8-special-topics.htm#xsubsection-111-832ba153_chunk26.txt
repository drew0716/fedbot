Based on a Reserve Bank's daily monitoring, if a loan is deemed to be impaired, the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section should be notified immediately. The quarterly process includes the following: Identification of loans and relevant financing receivables that need to be evaluated under FASB ASC Topic 326, Financial Instrumentsâ€”Credit Losses. For loans and relevant financing receivables for which an allowance for credit loss estimate was determined to be necessary under FASB Topic ASC 326 in previous periods, review key inputs, methodology, and assumptions into the allowance for credit loss to ensure that any requisite changes to the estimate are updated and properly reviewed. For loans and relevant financing receivables (for newly originated or purchased financial assets), determine the appropriate estimate methodology, and key inputs and assumptions to develop an allowance for credit loss for instances where the Bank has concluded that there is an expected credit loss (even when considered remote). See paragraph 81.03 for guidance on developing an allowance for credit loss estimate. For loans and relevant financing receivables for which the "zero-loss expectation" exception has been elected, review previous facts and circumstances supporting that conclusion to ensure the "zero loss" assertion is still appropriate.
