For example, the fair value of a lease at commencement would be its cost, including any acquisition costs, such as sales taxes and delivery charges. However, if a significant lapse of time occurs between the acquisition of the underlying asset (the lease) and lease commencement, lessors would be required to determine fair value in accordance with ASC 820.

Valuation techniques used to measure fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Market participant assumptions should include assumptions about the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset if market participants would consider the effect of the restriction in pricing the
