for the payment of dividends for a year in which its current earnings are insufficient for that purpose. It is a fundamental principle of the law of corporations, that unless otherwise provided by statute, charter or other limitation, the question of whether a corporation which has surplus profits on hand shall declare a dividend, and what part of such profits shall be distributed by means of such dividend, is a question for the determination of the directors in the exercise of their discretion, and the courts will not interfere with action taken by the directors in the exercise of such discretion unless they act fraudulently or in bad faith. Gibbons v. Mahon, 136 U.S., 549 ; N.Y. Ry. Co. v. Nickals, 119 U.S., 296 . See also 14 Corpus Juris, p. 808-810 and cases there cited. It is also held generally that dividends may lawfully be declared out of any surplus of corporate assets over corporate debts and capital stock, that is to say, anything remaining after provision for the corporation's capital stock and liabilities is properly available for distribution to stockholders, although as seen above its actual disposition rests with the directors: Bowers v.
