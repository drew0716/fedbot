Powell Engaging in Community Economic Development Activities Another critical way the Federal Reserve promotes consumer protection and community development is by engaging, convening, and informing key stakeholders to identify emerging issues and policies and practices to advance effective community reinvestment and consumer protection. The Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Banks interact directly with communities and community stakeholders through a wide-ranging, nationwide community development outreach program, with the ultimate purpose of understanding economic opportunities and challenges that either promote or hinder communities' participation in the nation's economic growth. For example, the Federal Reserve Board meets semiannually with members of the Community Advisory Council (CAC) to hear diverse perspectives on the economic circumstances and financial services needs of consumers and communities, with a particular focus on the concerns of low- and moderate-income populations.
