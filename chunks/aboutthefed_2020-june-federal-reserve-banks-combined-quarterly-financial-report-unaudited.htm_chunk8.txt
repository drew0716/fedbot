All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized. (6) Depository Institution Deposits Depository institutions' deposits primarily represent the balances in master accounts and excess balance accounts that depository institutions hold at the Reserve Banks. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances. Effective March 26, 2020, reserve requirements were removed and all balances held are excess balances. (7) Treasury Deposits The Treasury holds deposits at the Reserve Banks in a general account pursuant to the Reserve Banks' role as fiscal agent and depositary of the United States. (8) Capital and Surplus The FRA requires that each member bank subscribe to the capital stock of the Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 percent of the capital and surplus of the member bank. These shares have a par value of $100, and may not be transferred or hypothecated. As a member bank's capital and surplus changes, its holdings of Reserve Bank stock must be adjusted. Currently, only one-half of the subscription is paid in, and the remainder is subject to call. A member bank is liable for Reserve Bank liabilities up to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it. The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semiannually and is cumulative. The FRA limits aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to $6.825 billion. The Treasury equity contribution to the consolidated VIEs is reported as an element of "Non-controlling interests in consolidated variable interest entities formed to administer credit and liquidity facilities" in the Combined statements of condition. The reported amount also includes Treasury's allocated portion of undistributed net VIE assets as of June 30, 2020, determined in accordance with VIE agreements and accounting policies adopted by the VIEs.
