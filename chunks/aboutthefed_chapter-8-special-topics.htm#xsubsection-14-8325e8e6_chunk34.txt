unique profile. Accordingly, specific evaluation and valuation criteria, while consistent with the methodology described herein, should be developed for each program. Determine allowance for credit loss The Reserve Bank should evaluate the fair value of the collateral to determine if an allowance for credit loss is appropriate. If the fair value of the collateral is greater than the recorded investment in the loan, there is no loss allowance to be recorded. If the fair value of the collateral is lower than the recorded investment in the loan and foreclosure is probable, or foreclosure is not probable but the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral (i.e., falling under the collateral-dependent practical expedient), calculate the allowance for credit losses under the collateral-dependent measurement approach outline under FASB ASC Topic 326-20 and FAM paragraph 81.03 . If applicable to the specific loan, review any coverage provided by the indemnity agreement between the FDIC or National Credit Union Administration and the Reserve Bank. Refer to FASB Topic ASC 326-20-30 for further guidance on credit enhancements within the loss allowance estimate process. 81.08 Unfunded Commitments Identify unfunded commitments that are
