than the fair value presentation, more appropriately reflects the financial position associated with the Reserve Banksâ securities holdings given the Systemâs unique responsibility to conduct monetary policy. Although the application of fair value measurements to the securities holdings may result in values substantially greater or less than their carrying values, these unrealized changes in value have no direct effect on the quantity of reserves available to the banking system or on the ability of the Reserve Banks, as the central bank, to meet their financial obligations and responsibilities. Both the domestic and foreign components of the SOMA portfolio may involve transactions that result in gains or losses when holdings are sold before maturity. Decisions regarding securities and foreign currency transactions, including their purchase and sale, are primarily motivated by monetary policy and financial stability objectives rather than profit. Accordingly, fair values, earnings, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of such securities and currencies are incidental to the open market operations and do not motivate decisions related to policy or open market activities. Accounting for these securities on a settlement-date basis, rather than the trade-date basis required by GAAP, better reflects the timing of the transactionâs effect on the quantity of reserves in the banking system. In addition, the Reserve Banks do not present a Statement of Cash Flows as required by GAAP because the liquidity and cash positions of the Reserve Banks are not a primary concern given the Reserve Banks' unique powers and responsibilities as a central bank. Other information regarding the Reserve Banks' activities is provided in, or may be derived from, the Statements of Condition, Operations, and Changes in Capital. Other than those described above, the accounting policies described in FAM are generally consistent with those in GAAP.
