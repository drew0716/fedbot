Finds The Federal Reserve regularly informs the public and Congress about its supervisory and regulatory activities and policies, including its assessment of the health of the banking sector. For instance, the Federal Reserveâs semiannual Supervision and Regulation Report provides analysis and updates on banking system conditions, recent regulatory changes, and supervision developments. These reports are often accompanied by testimony to Congress by the Boardâs Vice Chair for Supervision. Other efforts that promote accountability and transparency include releasing the results of the Fedâs annual stress testing of large banks, and website postings of its enforcement actions and orders on applications related to bank mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions.
