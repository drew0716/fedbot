Example 1: Assume an employee accumulates vacation time throughout the year and, at the end of the year, has accumulated four weeks of vacation time. The District's policy allows employees to carry over a maximum of three weeks of vacation to the following year. The District should accrue a liability for the cost of three weeks of accumulated vacation time (accumulated portion), even if the District's policy is to pay only a maximum of two weeks of vacation in the event of termination (vested portion).
