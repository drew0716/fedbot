the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset where these costs are not anticipated to be recoverable in the future. A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue. A current expectation that it is "more likely than not" that the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Does the carrying value (book value) exceed the amount that can be recovered (undiscounted net cash flows)? This step is focused on whether the current value is recoverable not whether it is impaired. It is possible, for example, that an asset could have a carrying value well in excess of current market prices that still produces enough cash flows to cover its costs. Loss impairments are not recognized in these cases. The undiscounted cash flows include the cash flows throughout the life of the asset (group) including disposal.
