The present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate The fair value of the collateral if the loan is nonrecourse Probability of default/loss given default 1. Present Value of Expected Cash Flows Method The discounted cash flow method estimates an allowance for credit losses by calculating the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the present value of the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected. Based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, the Bank must exercise significant judgment to develop the best estimates of expected future cash flows. All available inputs, including estimated selling costs if those costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan, should be considered in developing the estimate of expected future cash flows. The weight given to the inputs should be commensurate with the extent to which the factors can be verified objectively. If the Bank estimates a range for either the amount or timing of possible cash flows, the likelihood of the possible outcomes shall be considered in determining the best estimate of expected future cash flows. Other considerations may exist such as loan-specific credit protection
