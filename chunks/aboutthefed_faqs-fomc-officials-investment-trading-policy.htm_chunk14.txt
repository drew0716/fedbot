may defer capital gains taxes resulting from the sales if the proceeds are promptly reinvested in diversified mutual funds or diversified ETFs.

Q87: What will happen if covered individuals violate the Policy for Covered Individuals, such as by failing to execute a pre-cleared trade? Updated: 2/5/2024 A87: The consequences of any particular instance of noncompliance with the policy will depend on a number of factors, such as the severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional or inadvertent, and whether the violation was a first or repeat offense. Q88: How does the Policy for Covered Individuals apply to automatic stock buybacks that occur as the result of a corporate acquisition? Updated: 2/5/2024 A88: The policy’s advance notice, pre-clearance, and trading blackout requirements apply to securities transactions that are controlled by or subject to the control of a covered individual or their spouse or minor child. Unlike trades of securities that are held within a managed account or trust account that are controlled by a covered individual or their spouse or minor child, stock buybacks typically are not subject to such control, and occur automatically upon a corporate acquisition. Therefore, unless a covered individual or their spouse or minor child controls the corporate acquisition, an automatic stock buyback is not subject to the policy’s advance notice and pre-clearance requirements or the trading blackout restrictions.
