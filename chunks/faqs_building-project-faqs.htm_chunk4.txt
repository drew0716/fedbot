What were the main reasons for cost increases over the course of the project?
Various factors have driven cost increases. Key factors include:
Changes to original building designs as a result of consultation with review agencies;
Differences over time between original estimates and actual costs of materials, equipment, and labor; and
Unforeseen conditions (for example, more asbestos than anticipated, toxic contamination in soil, and a higher-than-expected water table).
