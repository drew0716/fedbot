The measurement cost of the right-of-use asset shall consist of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, and any initial direct costs incurred by the Reserve Bank lessee minus any lease incentives received. 8 A materiality threshold has been established for the balance sheet recognition of lessee leases: the materiality test for a finance lease is that each identified leased asset value equals or exceeds $100,000; the materiality test for an operating lease is that lease payments over the lease term for each operating lease item equals or exceeds $100,000. Potential finance leases with lease payments over the lease term in excess of $500,000 along with the proposed accounting treatment should be sent to the
