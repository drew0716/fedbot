observed. Note, if a reasonable and supportable forecast for future economic conditions is unable to be estimated, no economic adjustment should be made for those periods. The calculation is based on a formula commonly used in practice to develop a credit loss allowance: $Expected Loss = PD% * LGD% * $EAD 3 PD—Probability of default 4 LGD—Loss given default EAD—Exposure at default 5 As a general practice, PD is based on the borrower's risk rating or credit rating and LGD/EAD is based on the underlying collateral and other recourse for each individual loan. The specific approach should be suitably developed for each program given the nature of underlying portfolio and data availability as discussed below. The loans extended by the Banks under each facility are collateralized. They differ, however, in that some loans are with recourse while others are extended on a nonrecourse basis to the borrowers. As a result, the loss calculation for each differs. For example, For nonrecourse loans, this calculation should be based on the underlying collateral of the individual loan rather than the loan counterparty, because the pledged collateral is the only source of recovery in the event of the borrower's default on the loan.
