In addition, because the CFPB contribution formula is specifically required by the Dodd-Frank Act and not based on a benefit formula or linked to the participating employee benefits, the amount funded by each employer does not indicate that the assets are severable. The System plan's funded status for each participating employer is not determinable because the plan assets are not severable, and they will not be tracked separately. 8 Conclusion Previously, the FRBNY and effective August 1, 2023, the FRBA accounts for the System Plan in a manner that is consistent with the accounting for a single employer plan.
