recognition of software and certain lease transactions. Deferred charges $25,000 or greater should be recorded in this account and amortized over the current and prospective periods that benefit from the expenditure. Deferred charges should include items such as finance lease right-of-use assets and operating lease right-of-use assets costs of major improvements to leased space and lease incentives paid to tenants that should be amortized over the life of the contract or lease respectively. (See paragraph 30.85 for further discussion of leasehold improvements.) The deferred charges account should also be used to record charges for internal use software, including software licenses under cloud computing arrangements (CCAs), which is defined as software acquired, internally developed, or significantly modified for use by the Reserve Banks in performing their operations. Additionally, the deferred charges account should be used to record implementation costs associated with CCAs that do not contain a software license. Internally developed software and implementation costs associated with CCAs that do not contain a software license should be capitalized if the cost exceeds $100,000. Externally purchased software should be capitalized if the costs exceed $25,000 per license. 4 Desktop utility software and maintenance should be charged to current expense regardless of amount.
