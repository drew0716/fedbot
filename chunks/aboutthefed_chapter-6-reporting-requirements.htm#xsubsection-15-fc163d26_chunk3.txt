This annual information should be made available in the WTB for retrieval by the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section by the designated January date as specified in special instructions from the Board. This report is used to prepare the statement of income and expenses of the Federal Reserve Banks in the Board's Annual Report. The amount reported for net expenses should agree with the same item reported in annual Profit and Loss information in the WTB. 60.39 Real Estate Reporting Requirements—Annual and Special This section provides instructions for the preparation and submission of accounting reports FR 612 and FR 892. Book Value of Bank Premises or Other Real Estate Form FR 612 is a summary of changes in the book value of Bank premises and other real estate and should be submitted to the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section by the date specified within the RBOPS provided year-end instructions. The annual FR 612 is the primary source of data for completion of the Annual Report table, Acquisition Costs and Net Book Value of Premises (including vaults) of the Federal Reserve Banks and Branches. An FR 612 report should also be submitted whenever property is purchased or sold. Bank-Owned Property Leased to Outside Tenants and Non-Bank-Owned Property Leased for Bank Use Form FR 892 is dual purpose because it is used to report either the lease of Bank-owned property to outside tenants or the lease of non-Bank-owned property (outside space) for Bank use. Each office should submit an annual report, indicating lease or rental agreements in effect on December 31. A report should be submitted whether or not the office is leasing or renting space. In addition to operations and office space, the report should identify leases for functions such as warehouse, storage, screening, etc. If there are no leases in effect at the end of the calendar year, this should be indicated in the body of the report. Form FR 892 should reach the RBOPS Building Planning Section by January 20 or the next business day of the year following the reporting period. In addition, a report should be submitted whenever a change occurs in a lease or rental agreement including identifying new and/or terminated leases. The reporting form is designed to accommodate information concerning several leases or rental agreements. In submitting the data, each lease or agreement should be shown on a separate line of the report. If an office is both leasing Bank-owned property to outside tenants and leasing non-Bank-owned property for Bank use, separate reports should be submitted covering each type of transaction, rather than combining them on the same report. Financial accounting and facility management staff are encouraged to collaborate to provide the appropriate information to complete the reports. Following are specific instructions concerning the data to be reported as of December 31 under the various columns of this report. Bank-owned Property Leased to Outside Tenants Location of space —Identify the location of the leased space within the building (e.g., third floor). Effective date of lease —The contractual date the lease begins (may not correspond to the date the first lease payment is due such as if rent abatement is part of the lease terms). Indicate if the lease amount is on a month-to-month basis. Expiration date of lease —The contractual date the lease expires (typically the date the last lease payment covers). Annual rental income —The annual rent due from the tenant for the reporting period for the base rent amount. Exclude additional rent to recover items such as reimbursement of increased operating cost (utilities, real estate taxes, etc.) or rent derived from the use of Bank spaces (auditoriums, training or conference rooms, etc.). Exclude amortization of leasehold improvements in the rent figure. Rented square feet —The amount of space rented that serves as the basis for the base rent in the lease agreement (defined in terms of rentable square feet). Tenant name and use of space —The name of the tenant on the lease documents and the function(s) for which the tenant intends
