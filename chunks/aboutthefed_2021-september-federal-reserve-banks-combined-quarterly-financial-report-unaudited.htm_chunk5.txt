The par amount shown for federal agency and GSE residential MBS and commercial MBS is the remaining principal balance of the securities. Return to table Federal agency and GSE residential MBS (RMBS) and commercial MBS (CMBS) are reported at stated maturity in table 7 above. The estimated weighted-average lives of these securities differ from the stated maturity in table 7 primarily because these estimated weighted-average lives factor in scheduled payments and prepayment assumptions. The estimated weighted-average life of RMBS was approximately 5.4 years and 3.1 years as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of CMBS was approximately 8.4 years and 8.8 years as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.
