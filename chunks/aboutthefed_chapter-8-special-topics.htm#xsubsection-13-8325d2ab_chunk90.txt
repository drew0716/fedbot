unrelated party. In the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees, expected present value measurement techniques will likely provide the best estimate of fair value. Generally, because of the unique nature of most guarantees, few are valued based upon "observable transactions for identical or similar transactions." The valuation of most guarantees, therefore, will require the use of fair value estimates. With respect to estimating fair value, FASB emphasizes that the fair value of a guarantee at inception is not equal to the guarantor's single best estimate of what it will be required to pay under the guarantee. It has further clarified that the notion of fair value contemplates the range of probabilities and potential payments that could be required under the guarantee, not merely a point estimate of the most likely outcome. FASB ASC Topic 460-10 does not prescribe specific accounting for the guarantor's offsetting entry when it recognizes a guarantee liability. That offsetting entry depends on the circumstances in which the guarantee was issued, as illustrated in FASB ASC Topic 460-10: If the guarantee were issued in a stand-alone transaction for a premium, the offsetting entry would be the consideration received (such as cash or a receivable).
