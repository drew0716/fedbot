loss experience for the current loan portfolio to differ from historical experience or from a comparison to other default and recovery rates, such as current market conditions, credit concentration, extraordinary portfolio characteristics, other environmental factors, asset-specific risk characteristics, and expectations of future market conditions. Subsequent Measurement Subsequent to the initial measurement of an impairment, if there is a significant change in the amount or timing of the expected future cash flows of an impaired loan, the Bank should recalculate the impairment by applying the principles described above and adjust the valuation allowance. If using the pooling methodology for estimating credit losses, an evaluation of whether the loans in the collective pool continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics with others in the pool should be performed. If the Bank measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral of an impaired nonrecourse loan, it should adjust the valuation allowance if there is a significant change in either the fair value of the collateral at measurement date or expectations of the future fair value of the collateral over the life of the loan. The net carrying amount of the loan should at no time exceed the recorded investment in the loan.
