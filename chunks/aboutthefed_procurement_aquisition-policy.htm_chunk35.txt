standards, purchase descriptions, and "brand-name or equal" descriptions for acquisitions should seek to promote economy and encourage competition in satisfying the Board's needs and should not be designed for the purpose of steering work to a particular vendor. B. Required Contract Clauses Clauses addressing the following issues must be included in all Board contracts, unless the Board's CAO has expressly waived the Board's rights regarding such issues. The general contract provisions set forth the standard language that should be included in the contract; however, if the vendor to whom the contract will be awarded requests non-substantive changes to such language, the CO may make such changes if they deem the changes to be reasonable and within the business interests of the Board.
