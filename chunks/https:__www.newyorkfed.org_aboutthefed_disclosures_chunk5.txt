a bi-annual basis in June and December of each year and include minutes from January 2007 onward. The documents include minutes for the Bank’s in-person board of director meetings, the bi-weekly board conference calls, and the board of directors’ committee meetings with the exception of the meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee. The release of minutes of the Audit and Risk Committee could impair the effectiveness of the Bank’s risk and audit-related controls. As captured in the minutes of the in-person meetings, the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee regularly reports to the full board. Redacted sections of the documents are limited to those that summarize the directors’ views of the state of the economy and markets, which can include confidential commercially sensitive information. In addition, the names of certain personnel have been redacted due to privacy concerns, as well as information that if released could represent a security risk for the Bank. The Bank has issued a limited waiver of otherwise applicable privileges and exemptions with respect to the documents posted to date. Going forward, the Bank may from time to time assert additional privileges and exemptions as warranted. Meeting Minutes Jul. - Dec. 2023 Jan. -
