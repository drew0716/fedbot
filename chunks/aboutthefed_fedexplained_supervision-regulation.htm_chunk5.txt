Stress Testing Large Banks' Resilience The Federal Reserve conducts annual stress testing of large banks to ensure they are financially resilient enough to continue lending to households and businesses even in a severe recession. As part of the testing, the Fed develops scenarios and models for different hypothetical, adverse conditions that could occur in the economy. Banks submit detailed data in response to the scenarios and models, and the Fed evaluates the data to project how banks are likely to perform under the hypothetical conditions.
