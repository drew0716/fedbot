not be recoverable according to ASC Topic 350-40: Internal-use computer software or the cloud computing arrangement is not expected to provide substantive service potential. A significant change occurs in the extent or manner in which the software or the cloud computing arrangement is used or is expected to be used. A significant change is made or will be made to the software program or the cloud computing arrangement. Costs of developing or modifying the internal-use computer software significantly exceed the amount originally expected to develop or modify the software. When it is no longer probable that a software project will be completed, no further costs should be capitalized and any costs that have been capitalized should be written off. Any expected recovery of accumulated costs from third parties, including the U.S. Treasury, should be considered in the write off. Indications that the software may no longer be completed include: the lack of commitments to fund further development the discontinuance of the business segment the software was designed for the inability to resolve programming difficulties timely significant cost overruns or a decision to obtain third-party software instead and abandon the current software development. 13.
