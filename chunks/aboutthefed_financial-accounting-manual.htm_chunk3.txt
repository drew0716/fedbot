development of accounting policies included in this manual. FAM provides guidance to Reserve Banks that should result in uniform accounting policies conforming to the standards established. In some places, FAM provides examples of subsidiary accounts to facilitate an understanding of the scope of the broader balance sheet items. In these cases, unless otherwise noted, the maintenance of such accounts is discretionary with the Reserve Bank. Although FAM covers the receipt and disbursement of funds and specifies their location on the balance sheet, and is thus the controlling document on capitalization, rates of depreciation, correction of errors in expenses, entries to Profit and Loss, and so on, it does not provide guidance for cost accounting. The Federal Reserve Cost Accounting for Strategic Planning and Reporting (CASPR Manual) sets rules for cost accounting. Federal Reserve Bank staff should consult with the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section on financial accounting questions or issues that are not specifically covered in this manual. The section's email group is RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting. Footnotes 1.
