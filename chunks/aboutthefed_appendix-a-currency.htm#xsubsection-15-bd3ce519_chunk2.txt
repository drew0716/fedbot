to extend the estimated useful life of the BPS 3000 currency processors (CP) and reconciling stations (RS) from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2022. This change in the estimated useful life is supported by both the BPS 3000 upgrade that was completed in 2010 and by the added functionality to the system. The upgrade introduced technology that will support the currency authentication and verification process over the next 10 years. Further support for the change to the estimated useful life is based on the enhancements to the machine via new and upgraded sensors in 2012 and 2013 and from the extended maintenance terms with Giesecke & Devrient America, Inc. through 2022. The estimated useful life change is effective January 1, 2013. Useful life history of the BPS 3000 machines: In 1992, the BPS 3000 machines were installed with a 10-year useful life. In 1997, the useful life was extended 5 years, until 2007. In 2004, the useful life was extended an additional 10 years, until 2017. In 2012, the useful life was extended an additional 5 years, until 2022. The machines were originally thought to have a 30-year useful life, but the original 10-year life was based on the
