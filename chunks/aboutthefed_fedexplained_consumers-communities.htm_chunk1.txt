Skip to main content ANIMATIONS OFF How We Promote Consumer Protection and Community Development Engaging with Consumer and Community Perspectives The Federal Reserve is responsible for promoting consumer protection and community development to help ensure a fair and transparent financial services marketplace that benefits all Americans. The Federal Reserve understands that healthy communities and well-served consumers help support and drive economic growth. That's why the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that consumer and community perspectives inform its policy, research, and actions. We all benefit more from a thriving, well-functioning economy when we have access to affordable and accessible financial products and services —like bank accounts, credit cards, and mortgages—that help us all save, invest, buy a home, borrow money, and more basically, provide financial security for our families and futures. Watch: Building a more inclusive financial system The Federal Reserve's Consumer-Focused Supervision and Regulation The Federal Reserve helps ensure that bank lenders and other financial institutions follow the federal laws and regulations that ensure that quality products and services are fairly offered and accessible to consumers and communities. The Federal Reserve shares this responsibility with various federal agencies, supervising financial institutions and enforcing these important consumer and community protections.
