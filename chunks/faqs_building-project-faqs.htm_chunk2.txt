What are the goals of the project?
The Federal Reserve takes seriously the responsibility to be a good steward of public resources. The project will reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations. It involves a complete overhaul and modernization that preserves two historic buildings that have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s and includes:
Remediation and updates to make the buildings safe, healthy, and effective places to work by removing asbestos and lead contamination, and accommodating modern workplace technology.
Complete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical; plumbing; Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC); and fire detection and suppression systems.
Major structural work to bring the buildings up to modern code, including current accessibility, security, and safety standards.
The work will also restore and enhance space for the public along the National Mall.
