the analysis performed for section 9 and placed in service when substantially complete and ready for its intended use. When the majority of elements associated with a long term software development project are treated as separate software assets, but an element costs less than $100,000, the accounting treatment for this element should be discussed with Board staff. When identical software that is acquired is a bulk purchase of a number of low cost licenses that are licensed per server (for example software to be placed on many servers) or per user and individually are below the capitalization threshold, the bulk purchase can be capitalized as a single asset when it is material in value, that is $100,000 or more, and the license term is longer than one year. 3 A subsequent purchase of the same software that is acquired under the same contract (quantity not originally specified or â€˜up to quantity' is specified) and that does not meet the $100,000 threshold should be charged to current expense. 4 Standard desktop utility software (such as word processing, electronic mail, and anti-virus software) and maintenance should be charged to current expense regardless of amount. 4.
