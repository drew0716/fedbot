if any, is expected to be identified as the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Although more than one entity could have either of the characteristics described above, only one entity, if any, will have the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly affect the entity's economic performance. In certain circumstances, the Bank may determine that there is no primary beneficiary associated with a VIE. In these, circumstances, while variable interests exist, because there is no primary beneficiary no reporting entity consolidates the VIE. Senior beneficial interests and senior debt instruments with fixed interest rates or other fixed returns normally would absorb little of the entity's expected variability and, therefore, a holder of the most senior interests of a VIE likely would not be the primary beneficiary of that entity unless the VIE's subordinated interests are not large enough to absorb the VIE's expected losses. Further, senior interests normally are not entitled to any of the expected residual returns. A Bank that holds a senior financial interest in a VIE, however, should perform an evaluation to determine if it is the primary beneficiary. To determine if it is the primary beneficiary, the Bank
