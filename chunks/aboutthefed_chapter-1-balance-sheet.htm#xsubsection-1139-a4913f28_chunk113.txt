each retention period (i.e., payout date). Subsequent Adjustments to Accruals In periods after initial measurement (communication date), changes in the accrued liability due to revisions in either the timing or amount of the estimated benefit payments should be recognized as an increase or decrease to the same expense line items as when the liability was initially recognized. For example, if employees to be involuntarily terminated leave prior to the payment date (either within or outside the Bank), the liability recognized by the Bank for termination benefits should be reduced, this reduction would result in a credit to expense for that period. Consistent with the current practice of adjusting accruals for compensated absences, Reserve Banks should adjust these accounts whenever there is a significant event, such as the close of a window period. If current interest rates are low and the time period is relatively short, the difference between present value calculations and the nominal value should be immaterial. Therefore, in order to minimize complexity, cost, and opportunity for error, nominal values should be used for estimates of cash flows less than or equal to five years.
