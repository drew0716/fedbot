liquidity. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorized and directed the FRBNY to maintain standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The FRBNY holds amounts outstanding under these swap lines in the SOMA. These swap lines, which were originally established as temporary arrangements, were converted to standing arrangements on October 31, 2013, and will remain in place until further notice. The remaining maturity distribution of U.S. dollar liquidity swaps that were allocated to the Reserve Banks at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was as follows: Table 9. Maturity distribution of liquidity swaps (in millions) June 30, 2019 Within 15 days December 31, 2018 Within 15 days Euro $ 17 $ 4,197 Japanese yen — 10 Total $ 17 $ 4,207 The following table presents the realized gains and the change in the cumulative unrealized gains (losses) related to SOMA domestic securities holdings during the periods ended June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2018: Table 10. Realized gains and change in unrealized gain (loss) position (in millions) Six months ended June 30, 2019 Six months ended June 30, 2018 Realized gains, net Change in cumulative unrealized gains (losses) 1 Realized gains, net Change in cumulative unrealized gains (losses) 1 Treasury securities 2 $ — $ 94,189 $ 6 $ (55,956) GSE debt securities — 200 — (155) Federal agency and GSE MBS — 48,663 — (43,566) Total $ — $ 143,052 $ 6 $ (99,677) 1. Because SOMA securities are recorded at amortized cost, unrealized gains (losses) are not reported in the Combined statements of operations. Change in cumulative unrealized gains (losses) is calculated from December 31 of the previous year. Return to table 2. Realized gains for Treasury securities are reported in "Other items of income (loss): System Open Market Account: Treasury securities gains, net" in the Combined statements of operations. Return to table (3) Consolidated Variable Interest Entity (VIE) The combined financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of a limited liability company (LLC), Maiden Lane LLC (ML), which is consolidated by the FRBNY. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. During 2018, the FRBNY sold all remaining securities from the ML portfolio and in accordance with the ML agreements, net proceeds were distributed to the FRBNY. On November 1, 2018, ML LLC was dissolved. While its affairs are being wound up, ML LLC will retain minimal cash to meet trailing expenses and other obligations as required by law. The costs to wind up ML LLC are not expected to be material. At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, investments held by the consolidated VIE consisted primarily of $0.4 million in cash equivalents. ML had immaterial net income for the six months ended June 30, 2019, and net income of $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. (4) Federal Reserve Notes Federal Reserve notes are the circulating currency of the United States. These notes, which are identified as issued to a specific Reserve Bank, must be fully collateralized. All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized. (5) Depository Institution Deposits Depository institution deposits primarily represent required reserve balances and excess reserve balances. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances. (6) Treasury Deposits The Treasury holds deposits at the Reserve Banks in a general account pursuant the Reserve Banks' role as fiscal agent and depositary of the United States. (7) Capital and Surplus The Federal Reserve Act (FRA) requires that each member bank subscribe to the capital stock of the Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 percent of the capital and surplus of the member bank. These shares are nonvoting, with a par value of $100, and may not be transferred or hypothecated. As a member bank's capital and surplus changes, its holdings of Reserve Bank stock must be adjusted. Currently, only one-half of the subscription is paid in, and the remainder is subject to call. A member bank is liable for Reserve Bank liabilities up to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it. The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semiannually and is cumulative. In 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act reduced the statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus from $10.0 billion to $6.825 billion, which required Reserve Banks to make two lump sum payments to the Treasury totaling $3.125 billion. These lump sum payments were reported as a component of "Earnings remittances to the Treasury" in the Combined statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The FRA currently limits aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to $6.825 billion. (8) Income and Expense (A) Loans Interest income on primary, secondary, and seasonal credit is accrued using the applicable rate established at least every 14 days by the Reserve Banks' boards of directors, subject to review and determination by
