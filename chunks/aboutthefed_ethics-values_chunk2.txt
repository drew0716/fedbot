At the Federal Reserve we hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and accountability in the pursuit of our important public mission.

These rules are found in federal statutes and regulations, in Reserve Bank codes of conduct, and in the policies of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This web page is designed to provide information on these provisions and answers to frequently asked questions.
