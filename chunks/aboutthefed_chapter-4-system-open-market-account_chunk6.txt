account is achieved by increasing the Bank's holdings of securities. The resulting percentage of each Bank's participation in the SOMA portfolio is used, until the next reallocation, as the basis for allocating the daily SOMA transactions. The following is a simplified illustration of the procedure that is performed each April: Assume that Reserve Bank A has gold certificates balance of 105, securities of 2,000, outstanding Federal Reserve notes of 2,000, and during the 12 months ending in March, its ISA settlement account averaged -5. The gold certificate total of all Banks combined is 10 percent of the combined Federal Reserve notes. The ISA settlement account will be adjusted by debiting it for 5. The offset to the above ISA entry is to credit the gold certificate account for 5. The gold certificate account will be adjusted to equal ten percent of the outstanding notes total (2,000 x 10% = 200), increasing the gold account by 100 (200 â 100 = 100). The offset to the final change to gold account (100) is deducted from the SOMA securities account (2,000 â 100 = 1,900). Example: Gold ISA SOMA Dr. Cr. Dr. Cr. Dr. Cr. Balance before the annual adjustment 105 10 2,000 1. ISA 5 2. Gold 5 3. Gold 100 4. Securities 100 Balance after adjustment 200 â 5 1,900 Foreign Participation All foreign currency denominated activity is participated based on the ratio of each Reserve Bank's capital and surplus to the Reserve Banks' aggregate capital and surplus using the preceding December 31 balances. Specific securities are not participated to the individual Reserve Banks and the amounts on each Bank's books reflect an undivided interest. The accounts are reallocated annually. Footnotes 1. The annual audited financial statements, however, are adjusted to reflect foreign-exchange contracts that are unsettled at year-end, effectively adopting trade-date accounting for the audited financial statements only. Return to text 2. The domestic allocation rate is also used for reverse repurchase agreements with foreign officials and international accounts. Return to text 3. All activity is participated daily, except acceptances, margin balances, interest expense on margin balances, and MBS fail charge income, which are participated monthly.
