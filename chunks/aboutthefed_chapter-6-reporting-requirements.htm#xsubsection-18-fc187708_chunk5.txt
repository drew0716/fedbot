Disadvantaged Business Awards 3 —Contract awards to firms that qualify as economically disadvantaged (minority) business concerns eligible for assistance under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. "Small Disadvantaged Business" is small as defined above, and in addition meets the criteria stated in section 8(A) of the Small Business Act; that is a business that is: (1) at least 51 percent owned, and (2) managed and operated on a daily basis, by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Such individuals are defined as those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Pacific Americans are among those considered socially disadvantaged. Women-owned businesses should not be reported in this category unless they are a small disadvantaged business as defined above. Supplemental Information should be captured as follows, if applicable. Set Asides —All contracts under $10,000 and any contracts over $10,000 for which proposals or bids were restricted to small and disadvantaged businesses. For proposals or bids to be restricted to small and disadvantaged businesses means that the list of vendors to which the proposal or bid is sent must be comprised of small and disadvantaged businesses only. If large businesses competitively bid on an item under or over $10,000 that is subsequently awarded to a small and disadvantaged business, the dollar value of this award should be reported as either a small business award or a disadvantaged business award. 60.50 Other Topics 60.52 Effect of Holiday on Clearings The Federal Reserve System observes the following holidays: New Year's Day–January 1 Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.–Third Monday in January Washington's Birthday–Third Monday in February Memorial Day–Last Monday in May Juneteenth National Independence Day–June 19 Independence Day–July 4 Labor Day–First Monday in September Columbus Day–Second Monday in October Veterans' Day–November 11 Thanksgiving Day–Fourth Thursday in November Christmas Day–December 25 Transactional activity related to Fedwire Funds, Fedwire Securities, National Settlement Service, ACH, Check and Cash Service only takes place on standard business days, and as a result, any related clearings for those services will not be processed on the above holidays. For holidays falling on Saturday, Federal Reserve Bank offices will be open the preceding Friday. For holidays falling on Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank offices will be closed the following Monday. When a Federal Reserve Bank closes for a non-standard holiday or unexpectedly, such as in the event of a local disaster, and is unable to participate in the clearing, the debits/credits for that office should be included with the debits/credits for the following business day and reported on the balance sheet in the line item "Due to Other FR Banks—Collected Funds" (220-075). 60.55 Earnings Remittances to Treasury Calculations Since 1947, the Board of Governors has required that the Reserve Banks remit to Treasury, as interest on Federal Reserve notes, all net earnings after providing for dividends and the amount necessary to equate surplus with capital paid-in. Effectively, this policy sets Reserve Banks surplus levels and requires, as a nondiscretionary expense, each Reserve Bank to remit all residual net earnings to the Treasury. Effective January 1, 2021, the Federal Reserve Act limits the Reserve Banks' aggregate surplus funds to $6.785 billion (see paragraph 12.60 ). The amount of the remittances to the Treasury that were required under the Board of Governor's policy is reported as "Earnings remittances to the Treasury, net" in the Combined Statements of Operations. The amount of remittances to the Treasury that are required by the Federal Reserve Act is reported as "Earnings remittances to the Treasury, net" in the Combined Statements of Operations. Before the implementation of the FAST Act, the Board of Governors, under authority of Section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act, had established the following described rate of interest on the outstanding Federal Reserve notes of each Bank less the amount of gold certificates pledged with the Federal Reserve Agent: The interest rate on Federal Reserve notes not covered by gold certificates pledged with the Federal Reserve Agent as collateral security for such notes shall be the result of the division of (a) the net earnings of the Federal Reserve Bank after provision for dividends on its outstanding Capital Paid In and for adjustments necessary to equate the amount of its Surplus with the amount of its Capital Paid In, by (b) the daily average amount of Outstanding Federal Reserve Notes of the Bank after deducting the daily average amount of gold certificates pledged with the Federal Reserve Agent as collateral security for such notes. Daily Accrual Earnings remittances to Treasury are accrued each day at an amount equal to the end-of-day balance in the Retained Earnings – Current Year account 330-275. Additionally, the Reserve Bank's surplus balance must be adjusted to ensure it does not exceed the Bank's portion of the aggregate surplus limitation. After recording this daily accrual and the surplus adjustment, if needed, the balance in the Retained Earnings – Current Year account 330-275 should be zero. Weekly Remittances The remittance to Treasury should be made each Wednesday. The amount of the remittance should be equal to the lower of the liability (credit) balance in the Accrued Remittances to Treasury / Deferred Asset account 240-925: For the previous Wednesday, or For the day preceding the remittance If, however, either of the two balances described above is zero or if the balance is a debit, no remittance should be made. In such cases, remittances to Treasury should not resume until sufficient net earnings have been realized to return the balance in the Accrued Remittances to Treasury / Deferred Asset account 240-925 to a liability (credit). A Reserve Bank should consult the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section if it
