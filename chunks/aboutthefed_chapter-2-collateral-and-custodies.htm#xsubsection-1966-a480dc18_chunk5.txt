For book-entry securities issued by international organizations, all Federal Reserve Banks (except the FRBNY) should classify their holdings of these securities as "Held By Other FRBs."

The following characteristics should be considered to determine the proper classifications for custodies on both office and District level FR 34s.

The classifications of "Held by DI's" and "Held by Other Offices in Own District" only apply to definitive securities and should never be used for book entry securities: Location of Physical Security All custodies held by an office must appear on that office's FR 34 Reverse as Held in Own Vaults .
