Pension F.1 Employer Accounting for the Retirement Plan for the Employees of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The purpose of this memorandum is to document the considerations and conclusions relevant to determining how the Federal Reserve's financial statements should reflect the employer accounting for the Retirement Plan for Employees of the Federal Reserve System (System Plan). The System Plan is a defined benefit pension plan that covers employees of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks (Banks), the Board of Governors (BOG), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) allows CFPB employees to participate in the System Plan. 1 The System employers account for their pension obligations in a manner consistent with GAAP. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715-30, employer accounting for pension benefits reflects the employer's financial interest for providing pension benefits net of assets held in separate pension entities. Because the System Plan provides for the payment of benefits to retirees from the assets of the plan without regard to the source of the funding, each employer's interest in the plan could not be computed and accounted for as separate financial positions. Instead, each employer's position is computed at a System level and reported on the financial statements of one Reserve Bank. We believe this treatment is the most appropriate and consistent with the intent of GAAP. This interpretation, however, is not clearly contemplated by the applicable accounting standards in that it arises from the unique structure of the Federal Reserve System. That is, the System employers are legally independent and not commonly owned and controlled, yet cooperate financially in the provision of pension benefits in a manner that would not normally exist among independent entities. The following explains the treatment of the System Plan as a single employer plan that was historically reflected on the FRBNY's financial statements, and, effective August 1, 2023, transferred to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (FRBA) financial statements following the integration of the Office of Employee Benefits of the Federal Reserve System (OEB) into the operations of the FRBA. Single/Multi-employer Accounting Much of the authoritative accounting literature on employer pension plan accounting focuses on whether the plan is characterized as a single-employer or a multi-employer plan. Essentially, the resources of single employer plans are incorporated into the employer's net pension asset/liability, the resources of multi-employer plans are not. The System Plan has many characteristics of a multi-employer plan, yet the related nature of its employers leads to the System's conclusion that it should be treated as a single employer plan. The citations/definitions discussed below present definitions of each term from key sources. FASB ASC Topic 715-30: Single-employer planâA pension plan that is maintained by one employer. The term may also be used to describe a plan that is maintained by related parties such as a parent and its subsidiaries. Multiemployer planâA pension plan to which two or more unrelated employers contribute, usually pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements. A characteristic of multiemployer plans is that assets contributed by one participating employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers since assets contributed by an employer are not segregated in a separate account or restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that employer. Multiple employer planâA pension plan where two or more unrelated employers contribute or pool their assets for investment purposes and to reduce plan administration costs. The assets contributed by an employer to a multiple-employer plan may not be used to provide benefits to participants of another sponsoring employer in the multiple-employer plan. FASB ASC Topic 960-10 specifies that administration is the most distinguishing characteristic between single employer plans and multiemployer plans. In a single employer plan, the employer is the plan sponsor. Multiemployer plans are normally negotiated and established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements between an associated group of employers, such as those whose employees are represented by a specific union, and the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan is a joint employer, union committee, or board. FASB ASC Topic 960-10 addresses the reporting-entity question for affiliated not-for-profit entities. The conclusion of this discussion is that "parent" entity within the group
