Community Advisory Council The Community Advisory Council (CAC) was formed by the Federal Reserve Board in 2015 to offer diverse perspectives on the economic circumstances and financial services needs of consumers and communities, with a particular focus on the concerns of low- and moderate-income populations. The CAC complements two of the Board's other advisory councils—the Federal Advisory Council and the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council—whose members represent depository institutions. The CAC meets semiannually with members of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. Records representing views expressed by the council at meetings are posted when available. Thank you for your interest in the CAC. The application window is currently closed. Members Carlos J.
