Federal Advisory Council The Federal Advisory Council (FAC), which is composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry, consults with and advises the Board on all matters within the Board's jurisdiction. The council ordinarily meets four times a year, the minimum number of meetings required by the Federal Reserve Act. These meetings are always held in Washington, D.C., customarily on the first Thursday of February, May, September, and December, although occasionally the meetings are set for different times to suit the convenience of either the council or the Board. Each year, each Reserve Bank chooses one person to represent its District on the FAC, and members customarily serve three one-year terms. The members elect their own officers. Members Robert F.
