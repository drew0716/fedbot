Because maintenance costs may be capitalized if costs exceed the FAM thresholds for prepaids and deferreds and training costs are expensed, the costs should be allocated among these services based on the value of the services. Vendors may have information that can be provided to assist in determining the costs of these services. The basis for allocation should be defensible. Because development of internal-use software may not follow the order as stated above (for example, coding and testing are often performed iteratively, or an Agile methodology is used) the accounting treatment should be based on the nature of the costs incurred, not the timing of their occurrence. 8. Software development labor rates Internally developed software costs that meet the FAM threshold should be capitalized using actual salaries and/or outside agency help (OAH) rate(s). 9 If actual costs are not readily determinable, a Reserve Bank may use either a blended or two-rate approach. Reserve Banks may use different rates based on varying skillsets, salary differentials, or project structures within a cost pool to help reduce the risk of distorting assets. The rate (blended or two-rate) that a Reserve Bank chooses to use should be consistently applied for all District assets. Rates
