the land either upon completion of construction or termination of the lease agreement. 30.86 Amortization of Leasehold Improvements Leasehold improvements should be amortized to current expense as rent over the shorter of the non-cancelable lease term as noted in paragraph 30.80 or the unique useful life of the asset, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Reserve Bank lessee or the Reserve Bank lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, in which case, the Reserve Bank lessee shall amortize the leasehold improvements to the end of their useful life. 30.87 Tenant Improvements For payments made to tenants for them to build out improvements in leased Bank premises, Reserve Banks should carefully evaluate the terms and conditions of the lease contract to assess which entity has control over the improvements i.e. the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the improvements during the term of the lease agreement. Reserve Banks should also evaluate if a modification to lease agreements was required in order for the tenant to build out the improvement. A modification could indicate that the asset is owned by the Reserve Bank.
