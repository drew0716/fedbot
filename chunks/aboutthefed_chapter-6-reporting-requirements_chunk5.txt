etc. If there are no leases in effect at the end of the calendar year, this should be indicated in the body of the report. Form FR 892 should reach the RBOPS Building Planning Section by January 20 or the next business day of the year following the reporting period. In addition, a report should be submitted whenever a change occurs in a lease or rental agreement including identifying new and/or terminated leases. The reporting form is designed to accommodate information concerning several leases or rental agreements. In submitting the data, each lease or agreement should be shown on a separate line of the report. If an office is both leasing Bank-owned property to outside tenants and leasing non-Bank-owned property for Bank use, separate reports should be submitted covering each type of transaction, rather than combining them on the same report. Financial accounting and facility management staff are encouraged to collaborate to provide the appropriate information to complete the reports.

The Reserve Banks are still required to maintain records suitable to provide ad hoc reports to the Board; however, the submission of an annual Form FR 1425 is no longer required. Summary Information should be captured as follows: Total Contract Awards âAll contracts awarded and commitment dollars for the year, except for those awarded for personal services. The full liability of all purchase orders and contracts should be reported in the year in which they are executed, including the liability associated with all years of a multi-year contract. For any blanket or retainer type contracts that have an "open-ended" or "not-to-be-exceeded" dollar value, actual expenditures rather than commitment dollars should be reported. Small Business Awards âContract awards, commitment dollars, and purchase orders to firms qualifying as a small business concern under the Small Business Act of 1953, as amended. Further, "small business" means a small business concern under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. Section 632) and the regulation promulgated thereto defining size standards for government procurement
