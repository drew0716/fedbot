VIE's expected losses. Further, senior interests normally are not entitled to any of the expected residual returns. A Bank that holds a senior financial interest in a VIE, however, should perform an evaluation to determine if it is the primary beneficiary. To determine if it is the primary beneficiary, the Bank must treat the financial interests (i.e., variable interests) held by its related parties as its own interests. For purposes of FASB ASC Topic 810-10, related parties include those parties identified in FASB ASC Topic 850-10, as well other parties that are acting as de facto agents. The following are considered to be de facto agents of the Bank: A party with a financial interest in the VIE that cannot finance its own operations without subordinated financial support from the Bank, such as another VIE in which the Bank is the primary beneficiary; A party with a financial interest in the VIE that received its interests as a contribution or a loan from the Bank; An officer, employee, or member of the governing board of the Bank; A party that has a financial interest in the VIE and has an agreement that it cannot sell, transfer, or encumber its interests
