Capitalized: None Expensed: All costs associated with preliminary stage activities. The development stage includes all the activities related to designing the chosen path including configuration and software interfaces, coding, testing (to include all testing prior to user acceptance testing), installation of software on hardware, preparation of code to convert old data, and development of user guides. Capitalized: external costs of materials and services (for example, consulting fees), salary and retirement and other benefit costs of employees directly associated with the project as outlined in section 8 preparation of developer guides costs associated with time spent specifically to oversee developers (programmers), if determinable expenditures for integration materials and services, which include consultant fees and salary and retirement and other benefit costs of employees directly associated with the integration effort. Integration efforts include customizing the infrastructure/operating system software so that the developed application will operate on the infrastructure hardware and within existing network environments. (In some cases integration costs may involve the components, installation, and related interconnectivity of hardware, which may require the allocation of integration costs between hardware and software.) travel costs for staff, consultants, or vendors should be capitalized if directly related to the software development and, when required, in
