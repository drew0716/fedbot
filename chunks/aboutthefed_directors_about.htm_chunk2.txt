Composition Reserve Bank Boards The Federal Reserve Act provides that Reserve Bank directors are divided into three classes—Class C, Class B, and Class A—of three directors each. Pursuant to the Act, the Board of Governors appoints Class C directors to represent the public, and designates a Chair and Deputy Chair for each Reserve Bank board from among that Bank’s Class C directors. Also by statute, Class B and A directors are elected by the member banks in their respective Federal Reserve District. Class B directors are elected to represent the public, and Class A directors are elected to represent the member banks. Branch Boards Most Reserve Banks, with the exception of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, have at least one Branch, and each Branch has its own board of directors. Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act, a majority of the directors on a Branch board are appointed by the Federal Reserve Bank in that District, and the remaining directors are appointed by the Board of Governors. Most Branch boards have seven directors, except for Helena, which has five directors.
