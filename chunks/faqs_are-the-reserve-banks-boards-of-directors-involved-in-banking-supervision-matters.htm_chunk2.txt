Are the Reserve Banks' boards of directors involved in banking supervision matters?
No. To avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest resulting from the financial interests and outside affiliations of Reserve Bank directors, Reserve Banks may not provide confidential supervisory information to any director. Moreover, Reserve Bank directors may not participate in bank supervisory matters and may not be consulted regarding bank examination ratings, potential enforcement actions, application/approval matters, or similar supervisory matters.
Similarly, because of the potential for an actual or perceived conflict of interest, Class A (banker) directors may not be involved in the selection, appointment, or compensation of Reserve Bank officers whose primary duties involve supervisory matters. Class B directors who are affiliated with a thrift holding company that is supervised by the Federal Reserve may also not be involved in the selection, appointment, or compensation of Reserve Bank officers whose primary duties involve supervisory matters.
