should recognize the credit loss by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to bad debt expense account or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the loans with a corresponding charge or credit to bad debt expense account. The valuation allowance should be recorded to FR 34 Account 145-360, Allowance for Credit Losses (credit); the expense provision should be recorded to Account 330-080, Provision for Credit Loss Expense (debit). The amount of the required valuation allowance is equal to the difference between the loan's impaired value (expected realizable value) and the recorded investment. The required charge or credit to bad debt expense is equal to the difference between the required valuation allowance and any existing valuation allowance related to that loan. The recorded investment in the loan includes the outstanding loan balance (net of any charge-offs), accrued interest, deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized premium or discount. The net carrying amount of the loan is equal to the recorded investment in the loan less the valuation allowance, or the impaired value. When the Bank determines that a portion of the loan or the entire loan will be uncollectable, the recorded investment in the loan is written down
