The Federal Reserve's Role in Maintaining a Reliable U.S. Currency Although the issuance of paper money in this country dates back to 1690 , the U.S. government did not issue paper currency until 1861, when Congress approved the issuance of demand Treasury notes. All currency issued by the U.S. government since then remains legal tender. Today, virtually all currency in circulation is in the form of Federal Reserve notes , which were first issued in 1914. As the issuing authority for Federal Reserve notes, the Board has a wide range of responsibilities related to paper money, from ensuring an adequate supply of currency to protecting and maintaining confidence in the currency. To protect the integrity of Federal Reserve notes , the Board works with the Reserve Banks, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the United States Secret Service to monitor counterfeiting threats for each denomination and to redesign notes to counter these threats.
