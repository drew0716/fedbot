Committee (FOMC) authorized and directed the FRBNY to maintain U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with foreign central banks. As of December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020, the FRBNY had standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. On March 19, 2020, the FRBNY entered into temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements to be in place for at least six months with the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Danmarks Nationalbank (Denmark), the Bank of Korea, the Banco de Mexico, the Norges Bank (Norway), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden). The FRBNY holds amounts outstanding under these swap lines in the SOMA. The remaining maturity distribution of U.S. dollar liquidity swaps at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, was as follows: Table 10.

Because SOMA securities are recorded at amortized cost, unrealized gains (losses) are not reported in the Combined statements of operations. Change in cumulative unrealized gains (losses) is calculated from December 31 of the previous year. Return to table 2. Realized gains for federal agency and GSE MBS are reported in "Other items of income (loss): System Open Market Account: Federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities gains, net" in the Combined statements of operations. Return to table (3) Federal Reserve Notes Federal Reserve notes are the circulating currency of the United States. These notes, which are identified as issued to a specific Reserve Bank, must be fully collateralized. All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized. (4) Depository Institution Deposits Depository institutions' deposits primarily represent the reserve and service-related balances in the accounts that depository institutions hold at the Reserve Banks. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances. (5) Treasury Deposits The Treasury holds deposits at the Reserve Banks in a general account pursuant to the Reserve Banks' role as fiscal agent and depositary of the United States. (6) Capital and Surplus The Federal Reserve Act (FRA) requires that each member bank subscribe to the capital stock of the Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 percent of the capital and surplus of the member bank. These shares have a par value of $100, and may not be transferred or hypothecated. As a member bank's capital and surplus changes, its holdings of Reserve Bank stock must be adjusted. Currently, only one-half of the subscription is paid in, and the remainder is subject to call. A member bank is liable for Reserve Bank liabilities up to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it. The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semiannually and is cumulative. The FRA limits aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to $6.825 billion. (7) Income and Expense (A) Loans to Depository Institutions and Other Loans, Net Interest income on primary, secondary, and seasonal credit is accrued using the applicable rate established at least every 14 days by the Reserve Banks' boards of directors, subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors. Interest income on advances made under the MMLF and PDCF is accrued using the applicable rate as outlined by the term sheets of the respective programs.
