the Comptroller without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 or subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code.

In setting and adjusting the total amount of compensation and benefits for employees of the Office, the Comptroller shall consult with, and seek to maintain comparability with, other Federal banking agencies. The Comptroller of the Currency may impose and collect assessments, fees, or other charges as necessary or appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the office of the Comptroller. Such assessments, fees, and other charges shall be set to meet the Comptroller's expenses in carrying out authorized activities. [12 USC 482; Revised Statutes § 5240, ¶¶ 3 and 4.
