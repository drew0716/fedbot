amount received for printing costs to the profit and loss account. (See paragraph 12.40 .) 50.45 Retirement Any Federal Reserve Bank may retire its Federal Reserve notes by returning them to the Federal Reserve Agent. The amount of notes that are retired should be debited on the balance sheet to Federal Reserve notes outstanding and removed from the amount of notes on hand. The notes may be reissued to the Bank as determined by the Assistant Agent in Washington D.C. However, it is not the practice to retire notes. 50.50 Redemption The law requires that unfit Federal Reserve notes be canceled, destroyed, and accounted for under procedures prescribed and at locations designated by the Secretary of the Treasury and that the credit for the unfit notes be apportioned among the Federal Reserve Banks as determined by RBOPS. The Cash departments commonly refer to the process of destroying Federal Reserve notes as "shreds." Shredding currency is one of the destruction methods permitted by the Treasury Currency Operations Manual (TCOM). All of the present size unfit currency in the $1â€“$100 denominations are to be regarded for initial accounting purposes as Federal Reserve notes. No sort is made of the Bank of issue.
