the purpose of obtaining U.S. dollar liquidity, the resulting asset is recorded by the FRBNY in account foreign currency held under liquidity swap arrangements (170-525). The foreign central bank compensates the FRBNY, based on the foreign currency amounts it holds. The FRBNY records the compensation received as interest income. Foreign Currency Liquidity Swaps When the FRBNY initiates a swap agreement with a foreign central bank for the purpose of obtaining foreign currency liquidity, any resulting asset is recorded in account foreign currency held under swap arrangements (170-530). For example, the FRBNY may enter into foreign currency liquidity arrangements whereby the Bank would obtain foreign currency from a foreign central bank; in a second and related transaction, the FRBNY may enter an agreement with a U.S. depository institution under which it would provide an equivalent amount of foreign currency liquidity to that depository institution. In this example, the foreign currency provided to the depository institution would be recorded as an asset in this account; see paragraph 11.99 for recording of the related liability. 4.95 Treasury Credit Protection (170-540) Per operation of the Facility Lending Programs, the FRBB received a Treasury credit protection and Treasury Investments for the Main Street Lending Program.
