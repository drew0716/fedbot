The covered individual later wants to sell all their shares in Fund Z in November 2025. In November 2025, the covered individual could sell the initial 40 shares of Fund Z—even if the shares have increased in value to be worth more than $200—as the one-year holding period for those shares expired on October 24, 2025.
