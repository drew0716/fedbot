literacy, and the role of the Federal Reserve. Presentations may be supplemented with a discussion on careers in economics, our educational and professional experiences as Research Assistants at the Fed, and special topics requested by the class or teacher. Typically, individual presentations are delivered by two Research Assistants during normal working hours for a duration of approximately one hour. When in person, we often visit multiple classes during any one visit to a school. We also welcome the opportunity to deliver a series of lessons to a class over multiple days, weeks, or a semester if a more detailed syllabus in economics or financial literacy is desired. We are currently offering virtual presentations for schools across the country and in-person presentations for local schools . Speaker Series: The FedEd Speaker Series provides local students with an opportunity to personally meet and hear from a senior-level officer at the Federal Reserve. Events are scheduled on a case-by-case basis. How to Sign Up: Sign Up FedEd is always looking for new ways to work in the community to achieve its mission.
