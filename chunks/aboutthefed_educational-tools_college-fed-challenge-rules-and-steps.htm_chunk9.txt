and Q&A session. Team presents their 15-minute presentation. No new slides or data should be introduced within the presentation. Judges will ask each team at least two similar questions. These questions will be the same for each team. Judges may modify their questions to cover topics mentioned in a teamâ€™s presentation. The question period is an opportunity to determine the extent to which students are knowledgeable about the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, and the information in their presentation. Questions may fall under any of these four categories: follow-up questions related to data, analyses, or recommendations made during the presentation (e.g., What evidence do you have to support your statement that deflation is more of a risk to the U.S. economy than inflation? How might your recommendation affect the economic circumstances of different areas/groups?) hypothetical questions (e.g., Suppose the number of new jobs created over the next three months totaled 100,000, would that change your prescription for monetary policy?) questions about macroeconomic theory (e.g., How much weight should policymakers give the Phillips curve?) questions about the Federal Reserve (e.g., Once the FOMC reaches its decision, how are policy decisions implemented?) Fed Challenge organizers announce winners. The final winner will be announced
