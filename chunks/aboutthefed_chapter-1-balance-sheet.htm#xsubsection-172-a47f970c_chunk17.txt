increase in its deposit liabilities (special account of the Secretary of the Treasury) matched by increases in two assets (SDR certificates—to the extent of its share in overall distribution effected by the Board—and Interdistrict Settlement account). In addition, pursuant to an agreement between the Federal Reserve and Treasury made in the 1960s, whenever the SDR account reaches a level of surplus, Treasury authorizes and requests the demonetization of SDRs. When this occurs, the FRBNY debits the special account of the Secretary of the Treasury with the total amount of such demonetization and credits the Bank's SDR account by a corresponding amount. As in a monetization, the Board participates these balances among all 12 Federal Reserve Banks. The FRBNY maintains an account for each Reserve Bank entitled "Special Drawing Rights certificate account." Amounts deposited with the FRBNY are distributed on the day of deposit rounded to the nearest million, and payment is made by direct entry to each Bank's Interdistrict Settlement account; i.e., the FRBNY's account is increased and accounts of other Reserve Banks are decreased. Entries in the opposite direction are made when Treasury reduces the total. Each Bank pledges the full amount in the SDR certificate account as collateral
