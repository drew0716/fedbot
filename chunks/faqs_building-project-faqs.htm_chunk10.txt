Who oversees the project?
The project is overseen by the members of the Board of Governors, all of whom are Senate-confirmed. It was first approved by the Board in 2017. It has been subject to annual budget approval by the Board since then.
The Board's independent Office of Inspector General (OIG) has had full access to the project information on costs, contracts, schedules, and expenditures and receives monthly reports on the construction program. The OIG conducted
an audit in 2021
to assess the Board's process for planning and managing multiple renovation projects as well as procuring services under various renovation-related contracts.
