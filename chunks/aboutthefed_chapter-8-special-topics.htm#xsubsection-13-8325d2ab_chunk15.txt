risks, such as portfolio mix or asset term, and also both the current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable future forecasts of economic conditions to develop a range of expected losses. Expected loss is the estimate of the current amount of loans for which the Bank will be unable to collect over the life of the loan given facts and circumstances as of the evaluation date. Based on historical experience and adjusted for asset specific risks, current economic conditions, and reasonable supportable future forecasts, evaluate the degree of likelihood that the borrowers will not pay, the amount of funds lost when the borrowers default, and the total amount the Bank may lose, or the Bank's financial exposure to at the time of default. Loss information should be applied to pools that are defined in a manner that is consistent with the pools for which the historical credit loss experience was observed. Note, if a reasonable and supportable forecast for future economic conditions is unable to be estimated, no economic adjustment should be made for those periods The calculation is based on a formula commonly used in practice to develop a credit loss allowance: $Expected Loss = PD% * LGD% *
