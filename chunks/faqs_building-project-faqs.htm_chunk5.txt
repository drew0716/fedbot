How is marble used in the project?
The Eccles and 1951 Constitution Avenue buildings were originally built with marble in the fa√ßades and stonework. The project has salvaged the original exterior marble to be reinstalled and will use new domestic marble where the original was damaged or where needed to keep with historic preservation guidelines and to address concerns raised by external review agencies.
