statements of operations. Return to table (4) Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) The combined financial statements include the accounts and operations of CPFF II, CCF, Main Street, MLF, and TALF II. The Reserve Banks that are controlling members have extended loans to the VIEs under the authority of section 13(3) of the FRA. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Purchases of each LLC's portfolio assets were funded by loans extended by the controlling Reserve Bank. The assets of the VIE and the amount provided by the Treasury as credit protection are used to secure the loan from the Reserve Bank. In January 2021, CCF, Main Street, MLF, and TALF II returned a portion of the Treasury's equity investment in each facility. CPFF II ceased purchasing commercial paper on March 31, 2021. Prior to the conclusion of CPFF II, when all obligations of CPFF II were repaid, the remaining net assets were allocated and distributed to FRBNY, in accordance with the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement of CPFF II. On June 29, 2021, CPFF II returned in full the Treasury's equity investment of $10 billion and the Treasury's allocated portion of earnings of the LLC of $49 million, as reported in table 15.

Return to table Investments held by the CCF and MLF are subject to review each reporting period to identify indications of other-than-temporary impairment, and no impairments were indicated as of June 30, 2021.

The evaluation of loan participations, including those in non-accrual status, resulted in recording a loan loss allowance of $2,545 million as of June 30, 2021.
