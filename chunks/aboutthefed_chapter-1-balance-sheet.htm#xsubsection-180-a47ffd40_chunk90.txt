by and reflected upon the books of the Reserve Bank. After all necessary expenses of a Federal Reserve Bank have been paid or provided for, the stockholders of the Bank shall be entitled to receive an annual dividend on paid-in capital stock. Semiannual dividends on the paid-in stock are paid by the issuing Reserve Bank on the last business day of June and December. These dividends are accrued daily (based on a 30-day month and 360-day year) and accumulate in this account from one payment date until the next. The total amount of the daily accrual is debited to Dividends Accrued (330-175), representing a deduction from current net earnings, and credited to Accrued Dividends Unpaid as the liability for dividends due but unpaid. Effective January 1, 2016, Section 7(a) of the Federal Reserve Act was amended by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), which revised the per annum dividend rate for member banks with consolidated total assets of more than $10 billion (large member banks) to the lesser of the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of such dividend, and 6 percent. 6
