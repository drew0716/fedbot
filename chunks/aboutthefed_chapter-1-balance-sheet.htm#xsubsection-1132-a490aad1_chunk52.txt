additional information related to the appropriate accounting for these costs. Costs incurred during the preliminary stage, such as evaluation of alternatives and prototype development, are expensed. Costs incurred in the development stage that are capitalized include external costs of materials and services (e.g., consulting fees and salary, retirement, and other benefit costs of employees directly associated with the product); costs associated with time spent specifically to oversee developers (programmers), if determinable; expenditures related to system integration, which includes consultant fees and salary, retirement, and other benefit costs of employees directly associated with the integration effort; integration costs must be analyzed to determine the allocation between hardware and software; implementation costs associated with activities to integrate, configure and/or customize a hosted cloud computing arrangement service; travel costs for staff, consultants, or vendors should be capitalized if they are directly related to the software development; and capitalizable costs paid to another Reserve Bank for software development efforts. Costs incurred during the development stage related to general and administrative expense and end-user testing and training should be expensed. Post-implementation stage costs generally should be expensed, except the cost of prepaid maintenance contracts, provided that the costs meet the FAM thresholds for prepaid assets
