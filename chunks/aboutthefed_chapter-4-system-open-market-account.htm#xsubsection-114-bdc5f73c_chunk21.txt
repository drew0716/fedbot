total is applied by the FRBNY against each Bank's holdings in the SOMA. Thus, a desired decrease in a Bank's gold certificate account is achieved by increasing the Bank's holdings of securities. The resulting percentage of each Bank's participation in the SOMA portfolio is used, until the next reallocation, as the basis for allocating the daily SOMA transactions. The following is a simplified illustration of the procedure that is performed each April: Assume that Reserve Bank A has gold certificates balance of 105, securities of 2,000, outstanding Federal Reserve notes of 2,000, and during the 12 months ending in March, its ISA settlement account averaged -5. The gold certificate total of all Banks combined is 10 percent of the combined Federal Reserve notes. The ISA settlement account will be adjusted by debiting it for 5. The offset to the above ISA entry is to credit the gold certificate account for 5. The gold certificate account will be adjusted to equal ten percent of the outstanding notes total (2,000 x 10% = 200), increasing the gold account by 100 (200 â€“ 100 = 100). The offset to the final change to gold account (100) is deducted from the SOMA securities account
