brief explanation for any dissenting votes. Since April 2011, the Chair has held a press conference following each FOMC meeting for which a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is prepared. The Chair begins each press conference with a prepared statement and then takes questions from journalists. Press conferences allow the Chair to provide additional detail about the rationale behind the FOMC's policy decision and how that decision relates to participants' projections for the economy over the next few years and to the FOMC's mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
