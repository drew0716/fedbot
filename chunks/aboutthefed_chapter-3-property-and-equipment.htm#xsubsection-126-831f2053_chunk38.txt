each asset that have been recorded in the subsidiary accounts of the Bank. Assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The depreciable basis of an asset is its acquisition cost less its estimated salvage value. The formula for calculating the straight-line method of depreciation is as follows: Cost less Salvage Value/Estimated Useful Life (in months) = Monthly Depreciation Charge Depreciation should continue until the asset is fully depreciated or disposed. At the end of an asset's estimated useful life, the asset's net book value should equal its salvage value and depreciation should be discontinued. Depreciation on impaired assets should continue until the Reserve Bank ceases the operations for which the asset is used.
