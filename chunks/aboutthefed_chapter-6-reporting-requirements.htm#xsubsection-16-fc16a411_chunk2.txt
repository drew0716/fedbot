income items reported as interest income or total other items of income or loss in the Combined Statements of Operations in both the Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Report and Federal Reserve System Audited Annual Financial Statements . The data should be made available to the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section through submission of the working trial balance (WTB) for the period. The WTB must be submitted by the date indicated in instructions issued by the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section for each period. 1 If an error is found in the amount of income reported for the current year, the necessary correcting entries should be made to the accounts in which the error occurred. In any calculation of average rates of earnings on assets, use holdings as of the close of business for each day included in the period under consideration in computing average daily holdings. 60.28 Profit and Loss Statement Reference paragraph 12.40 for the detailed listing of profit and loss items reported as interest expenses, operating expenses, or other items of income or loss in the quarterly and annual Combined Statements of Operations. The data should be made available to the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section through the WTB for the period, which must be submitted by the date indicated in instructions issued by the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section for each period. 2 Amounts reported on the detailed listing of profit and loss items should reflect the net for each category except that recoveries of losses on shipments of money and losses on shipments of money should be reported in "Other Items of Income or Loss." A brief description of the profit and loss account is given in connection with the discussion of the Balance Sheet in chapter 1 . The profit and loss account is intended primarily to cover items for which no provision is made in current income or expenses. These include realized gains and losses on sales of securities and on foreign currencies, profit or loss on the sale of real estate (originally acquired for potential Bank use), the write-off of stale officers' and certified checks ( paragraph 10.80 ), losses that are sustained in the handling or transportation of currency, recoveries and unrealized losses on the value of other real estate (originally acquired for potential Bank use) held for sale, and gains or losses on works of art. The account should not normally be used to adjust prior year income or expenses except for the correction of prior year accounting errors when the amount would seriously distort income or expenses of the current year. Entries to the account for prior year items may be made only with the prior approval of the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section. The profit and loss account should not include dividends and rebates on insurance policies or any additional premium payments on worker's compensation or other insurance regardless of the year for which the refunds or additional payments apply. Such amounts should be entered to current year income or expenses. Other items from the previous year, which should normally be applied to current year income or expenses rather than profit and loss, are receipts from vending machines, refunds from courier contracts, adjustments for the difference between accounts payable and the actual billings, and adjustments for the difference between accrued income from services and actual billings. The profit and loss account should also exclude losses arising from the ongoing operations of the Reserve Banks. Any such losses should be charged to current expense. 60.35 Annual Reporting 60.36 Annual Report The Board publishes the Annual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which provides the Board's financial statements, the Reserve Banks' combined financial statements, and pro forma financial statements for Federal Reserve priced services.
