The Federal Reserve Board's Role As the issuing authority for all Federal Reserve notes, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has a wide range of responsibilities related to paper money, from ensuring an adequate supply to protecting and maintaining confidence in our currency. Together with our partners at the Treasury Department , its Bureau of Engraving and Printing , and the United States Secret Service , we continuously monitor the counterfeiting threats for each denomination and make redesign decisions based on these threats.
