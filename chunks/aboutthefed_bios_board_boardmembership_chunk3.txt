Thomas Leadership Structure: 1936-Present The Banking Act of 1935 made several changes in the nomenclature and the structure of the Board. The Banking Act of 1935 renamed the "Federal Reserve Board" as the "Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System," the "governor" of the Board as the "chairman" and the "vice governor" as the "vice chairman" of the Board, and renamed "members" of the Board as "governors." The Banking Act of 1935 also made the following more structural changes: increased the number of members of the Board appointed by the President from six to seven required the President to designate one of the persons appointed as "chairman" of the Board and one as "vice chairman" of the Board, each to serve in such role for a term of four years specified that the appointive members in office on the date of the act should continue to serve until February 1, 1936, or until their successors were appointed and had qualified; thereafter, the members' terms should be 14 years specified that the ex officio members in office on the date of the act (the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency) were to continue to serve as ex officio members only until February 1, 1936, but made no further provision for ex officio members provided that the "chairman of the Board, subject to its supervision, shall be its active executive officer" The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 required the President to designate one of the persons appointed as "Chairman of the Board," by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and one as "Vice Chairman of the Board," by and with the consent of the Senate. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 required the President to designate, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a new "Vice Chairman for Supervision," who "shall develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution holding companies and other financial firms supervised by the Board and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms." A 2015 statute required that the President, in selecting members of the Board, "shall appoint at least one member with demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks having less than $10 billion in total assets."
