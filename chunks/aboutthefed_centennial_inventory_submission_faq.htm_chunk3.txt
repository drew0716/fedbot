information about the size and location of the historical collections. Is everything on the list available digitally? Not at this time; however, many items in the inventory are digitized, and information about web availability is included.

Material housed in other places may also be available on the web. In addition, the inventory includes material that has not been published.

It is hard to say with precision, but as part of the project, the Federal Reserve will increase the number of historical collections that it digitizes. Holders of collections outside of the Federal Reserve may or may not have plans to digitize their holdings; each institution has to make that determination based on available resources.
