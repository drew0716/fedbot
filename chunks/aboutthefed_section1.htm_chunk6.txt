Accordingly, the words "Federal Reserve Board", "governor", and "vice governor", wherever they formerly appeared in the Federal Reserve Act (or in other acts of Congress), have been changed here to read "Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System", "chairman" and "vice chairman", respectively, notwithstanding the fact that such change has not been made by specific amendment of the law. * An identical amendment was made by act of Oct. 16, 2006 (120 Stat. 2028).
