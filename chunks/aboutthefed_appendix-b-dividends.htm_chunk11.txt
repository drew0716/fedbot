the terms of the original Section 7, to pay dividends out of surplus. In my judgment Congress in amending Section 7 so as to require the accumulation of a surplus fund of unlimited size must be considered to have recognized that under both the original section and the section as amended the surplus fund could be used for the payment of the cumulative dividends. Otherwise, it is only reasonable to assume that Congress would have required or permitted some part of the earnings, which must now go into the unlimited surplus, to be paid into a fund of "undivided profits" out of which the dividends could be paid currently in a year of small earnings. This leads to the observation that under the terms of Section 7 a Federal reserve bank is not permitted to accumulate a fund of "undivided profits". It is the usual custom of commercial banks to show among their liabilities an item of "undivided profits", in addition to their liabilities on account of capital and surplus. From this fund of "undivided profits", dividends are customarily paid and from it also transfers are made from time to time to increase the surplus fund. No banks, so far
