to $6.785 billion. Reserve Bank surplus is allocated among the Reserve Banks based on the ratio of each Bank's capital paid-in to total Reserve Bank capital paid-in as of December 31 of each year. On a daily basis, the Board of Governors requires an adjustment to surplus to equate the surplus balance to the Reserve Bank's allocated portion of the $6.785 billion aggregate surplus limit. (See paragraph 12.60 .) AOCI is a component of each Reserve Bank's surplus account, and a separate account has been established to record transactions related to AOCI. (See paragraph 11.84 .) The balance of AOCI should be included with the Bank's surplus balance in computing the amount necessary to equate surplus to the Reserve Bank's allocated portion of the aggregate surplus limitation. Each Reserve Bank should ensure that all entries for transactions to the capital paid-in and AOCI accounts have been recorded before equating surplus to its allocated portion of the aggregate surplus limitation. The following adjustment should be recorded: Dr / Cr: Transferred to or from Surplus (330-225) $xxx Cr / Dr: Surplus (320-025) $xxx. 12.20 Current Income (330-025) This account includes income from all sources for the year to date.

Services âAmounts collected under Section 11A of the Federal Reserve Act for services to depository institutions. Revenues âBased on FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Customers, Reserve Banks should record revenues earned including amounts collected under Section 11A of the Federal Reserve Act for services to depository institutions for Check, ACH, Electronic Access, Funds, FedNow, Currency Fees, and Securities. Income from services is recorded as current income and should not be netted with the expenses incurred to provide the services or support costs paid to other Reserve Banks for costs that they incur in providing these services. Individual ledger accounts are maintained for control purposes and to facilitate verification of income according to source. In the case of income from services, the ledger should be supported by subsidiary accounts in the same detail as the schedule of priced services. These subsidiary accounts must be posted currently and, together with any accrual accounts that the Bank elects to maintain separately, added to the total in the ledger at the close of business each day. A subsidiary account may also be established for each priced service to record variances between accrued service income and the amount actually charged depository institutions due to absorption of differences. The use of this account should facilitate reconcilement of the general ledger with internal cost/revenue reports. 12.30 Operating Expenses (330-050) The balance of this summary account represents the combined year-to-date actual and estimated net expenses that the Reserve Banks have incurred in performing business operations. The operating expenses subaccounts are as follows: Operating Expenses . The balance of this subaccount represents year-to-date operating expenses, net of expenses reimbursed.
