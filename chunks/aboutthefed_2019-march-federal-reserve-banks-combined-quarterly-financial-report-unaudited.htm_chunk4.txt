Realized gains are reported in "Other items of income (loss): System Open Market Account" in the Combined statements of operations. Return to table 2. Because SOMA securities are recorded at amortized cost, unrealized gains (losses) are not reported in the Combined statements of operations. Change in cumulative unrealized gains (losses) is calculated from December 31 of the previous year. Return to table (3) Consolidated Variable Interest Entity (VIE) The combined financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of a limited liability company (LLC), Maiden Lane LLC (ML), which is consolidated by the FRBNY. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. During 2018, the FRBNY sold all remaining securities from the ML portfolio and in accordance with the ML agreements, net proceeds were distributed to the FRBNY. On November 1, 2018, ML LLC was dissolved. While its affairs are being wound up, ML LLC will retain minimal cash to meet trailing expenses and other obligations as required by law. The costs to wind up ML LLC are not expected to be material. At March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, investments held by the consolidated VIE consisted primarily of $0.4 million in cash equivalents. ML had immaterial net income for the three months ended March 31, 2019, and net income of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. (4) Federal Reserve Notes Federal Reserve notes are the circulating currency of the United States. These notes, which are identified as issued to a specific Reserve Bank, must be fully collateralized. All of the Reserve Banks' assets are eligible to be pledged as collateral. At March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, all Federal Reserve notes, net, were fully collateralized. (5) Depository Institution Deposits Depository institution deposits primarily represent required reserve balances and excess reserve balances. Required reserve balances are those that a depository institution must hold to satisfy its reserve requirement. Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Excess reserves are those held by the depository institutions in excess of their required reserve balances. (6) Treasury Deposits The Treasury holds deposits at the Reserve Banks in a general account pursuant the Reserve Banks' role as fiscal agent and depositary of the United States. (7) Capital and Surplus The Federal Reserve Act (FRA) requires that each member bank subscribe to the capital stock of the Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6 percent of the capital and surplus of the member bank. These shares are nonvoting, with a par value of $100, and may not be transferred or hypothecated. As a member bank's capital and surplus changes, its holdings of Reserve Bank stock must be adjusted. Currently, only one-half of the subscription is paid in, and the remainder is subject to call. A member bank is liable for Reserve Bank liabilities up to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it. The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semiannually and is cumulative. The FRA limits aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to $6.825 billion. (8) Income and Expense (A) Loans Interest income on primary, secondary, and seasonal credit is accrued using the applicable rate established at least every 14 days by the Reserve Banks' boards of directors, subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, primary, secondary, and seasonal credit average daily balances were $18 million and $32 million, respectively, and average interest rates were 2.83 percent and 1.94 percent, respectively.
