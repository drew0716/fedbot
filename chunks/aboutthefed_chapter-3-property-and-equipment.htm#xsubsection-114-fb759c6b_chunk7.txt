and equipment occur periodically as a result of adjusting assets to their estimated fair values. (See paragraph 30.95 .) Prior to 1996, construction costs for improvements or additions to a building were capitalized as part of the original building only if the addition or improvement significantly increased the useful life of the building beyond the current depreciation schedule or added functionality or space, in accordance with GAAP. In practice, ensuring accounting consistency for large improvement projects became burdensome, especially as some buildings approached the end of their initial useful lives. Since 1996, improvements to existing buildings are evaluated, capitalized, and depreciated as separate assets as a practical expedient. Accordingly, underlying asset values are not adjusted for capitalized improvements regardless of when the underlying asset was acquired. Improvement assets and accumulated depreciation, however, are adjusted if replaced or modified by a subsequent capitalized improvement and charged to depreciation expense. Two fixed asset policy changes were implemented in 2021 to align with standard accounting practices in parallel with the implementation of a new financial system: elimination of pooled accounting for furniture, furnishings, and fixtures; and elimination of the separate Building Machinery and Equipment account. The pooled asset method is described in paragraphs
