Because of the global character of bank funding markets, the Federal Reserve has at times coordinated with other central banks to provide liquidity. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorized and directed the FRBNY to maintain standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The FRBNY holds amounts outstanding under these swap lines in the SOMA. These swap lines, which were originally established as temporary arrangements, were converted to standing arrangements on October 31, 2013, and will remain in place until further notice.
