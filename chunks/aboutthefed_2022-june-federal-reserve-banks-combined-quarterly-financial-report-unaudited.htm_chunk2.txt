Primary and secondary loans are extended on a short-term basis, typically overnight, whereas seasonal loans may be extended for a period of up to nine months. Other Loans The Board of Governors authorized the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF) under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. The PPPLF program extended credit to eligible financial institutions that participate in the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program, taking the loans as collateral at face value. The PPPLF ceased extending credit on July 30, 2021. The amounts outstanding at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, for loans to depository institutions and other loans were as follows: Table 1.
