Currency A.1 Currency Shipments 1 A.2 BPS 3000 Machine Useful Lives On September 17, 2012, the Board of Governors' RBOPS Division approved the recommendation of the Cash Product Office to extend the estimated useful life of the BPS 3000 currency processors (CP) and reconciling stations (RS) from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2022. This change in the estimated useful life is supported by both the BPS 3000 upgrade that was completed in 2010 and by the added functionality to the system. The upgrade introduced technology that will support the currency authentication and verification process over the next 10 years. Further support for the change to the estimated useful life is based on the enhancements to the machine via new and upgraded sensors in 2012 and 2013 and from the extended maintenance terms with Giesecke & Devrient America, Inc. through 2022. The estimated useful life change is effective January 1, 2013. Useful life history of the BPS 3000 machines: In 1992, the BPS 3000 machines were installed with a 10-year useful life. In 1997, the useful life was extended 5 years, until 2007. In 2004, the useful life was extended an additional 10 years, until 2017. In 2012, the useful life was extended an additional 5 years, until 2022. The machines were originally thought to have a 30-year useful life, but the original 10-year life was based on the collective anticipated life of the System's information technology, data architecture, and computer components. Over time, the machines have continued to operate with new sensors and extended maintenance agreements. The current sensors have useful lives through 2022. Sensors have the capability to authenticate the current currency's design, and up to one additional currency design. The CTO extended the maintenance agreements through 2022 with the maintenance provider, which is confident of the viability of the technology over the extended period. Per FAM paragraph 30.76 , the change in estimate shall be accounted for prospectively such that the remaining net book value is depreciated over the expected remaining useful life of the asset. This extension applies to the BPS 3000 CP and RS and all production sensors. This change in estimate, however, does not affect the accounting for spare sensors because spare sensors are recorded as hardware assets, as of January 1, 2021, and depreciated over the life of the maintenance agreement. 2 A.3 Accounting for Currency Costs The costs incurred by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) for printing Federal Reserve notes are invoiced to the Board. The amount charged is based on the number and denomination of notes that are moved to dedicated storage vaults at BEP facilities ("Fed vault") during that month. When the BEP invoice is received by the Board, it assesses each Reserve Bank a pro rata share of the BEP's printing costs based on each Bank's share of the number of FR notes outstanding at December 31st of the previous year. The Board assesses the Banks for the printing cost, settles the assessment with the Banks, and remits payment to the BEP within the same accounting period. As a result, the Board has no residual asset or liability at any month- or year-end. The Reserve Banks record the scheduled assessment received from the Board directly to expense, in accordance with FAM (see paragraph 12.45 ). The following examines from a Reserve Bank perspective whether the inventory of Federal Reserve notes in the BEP vault, the cost of which has been paid by the Board, creates an asset of either the Board or the Reserve Banks. The analysis concludes that the current Reserve Bank accounting for these costs is appropriate. Federal Reserve Act Provisions The current accounting treatment by both the Board and the Reserve Banks is based on the relevant provisions of the Federal Reserve Act (the Act). Relevant excerpts are as follows: Section 16 (¶1)âFederal reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter set forth and for no other purpose, are hereby authorized. Section 16 (¶2)âAny Federal Reserve bank may make application to the local Federal Reserve agent for such amount of the
