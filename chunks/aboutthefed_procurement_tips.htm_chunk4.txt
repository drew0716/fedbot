To review the Board's forecast and register your company to do business, please visit our website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/secure/vendorregistration . All bids must be directed to Procurement in accordance with the solicitation. The Board hosts pre-proposal conferences for solicitations when it believes that doing so will foster a better understanding of critical elements of contract performance. Sales/marketing pitches in the context of a solicitation are inappropriate. However, the Board hosts and attends vendor fairs during which sales pitches are perfectly acceptable.
