The Federal Reserve supports research about communities and consumers, including the financially vulnerable, to understand their financial experiences and decisionmaking, and the major challenges they face, like getting access to financial services. Since 2013, the Federal Reserve has conducted the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, which measures the economic well-being of U.S. households and identifies potential risks to their finances. The survey covers a range of topics relevant to financial well-being, including credit access and behaviors, savings, retirement, economic fragility, and education and student loans. Dedicated research in these areas helps identify trends that may impact financial well-being and helps inform whether those trends suggest the need to adjust consumer protection efforts or policies that ensure low- and moderate-income communities' perspectives, challenges, and opportunities are well-represented.
