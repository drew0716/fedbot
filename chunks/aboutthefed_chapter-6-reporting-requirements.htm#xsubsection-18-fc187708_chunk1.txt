Reporting Requirements 60.01 General This chapter contains reporting instructions arranged according to the frequency of each report. A summary of all reporting requirements is contained in Table 60.99 . 60.10 Daily Reporting 60.11 Daily Preparation A balance sheet, form FR 34, for each Federal Reserve Bank should be prepared for each day. (See paragraph 60.52 for the standard holiday schedule.) Balance sheet data for each District should be transmitted to the Board daily. Technical procedures for the transmission of FR 34 data may be found in Technical Memorandum No. 15. Preliminary FR 34s are transmitted daily after completing the end-of-day closing process. Final FR 34 data should be transmitted to reach the Board no later than 1:30 p.m. eastern time on standard business days and 5:00 p.m. eastern time on non-standard business days. Standard business days are defined as Monday through Friday, excluding the Federal Reserve System holidays outlined in paragraph 60.52. Non-standard business days are defined as Saturday through Sunday, including Federal Reserve System holidays. Adjustments to prior day balances may be made before final balance sheets are submitted; however, adjustments to prior day Treasury and depository institution account balances require special procedures and should be rare. Notify the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section Manager of all prior day adjustments to Treasury and depository institution accounts. Special procedures are required for Wednesday, month-end, and year-end balance sheets. When Wednesday is not the first day of the month and is a holiday, or when the last day of the month is a holiday, the balance sheet for the preceding business day should reflect accruals of earnings, expenses, and dividends through the Wednesday holiday or the last day of the month. (See accrual instructions beginning with paragraph 11.56 .) At the end of each day, no amount should be reported in the undistributed net income account on the balance sheet. (See paragraph 60.55 for additional discussion.) 60.12 Confidential Daily Summary (L.6.1) The balance sheet data are consolidated daily and, together with figures from other sources, are used in preparing a confidential daily statement, which is furnished to the Board and various members of its staff, certain Treasury officials, and the Federal Reserve Banks. 60.15 Weekly Reporting 60.16 Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks (H.4.1) Section 11(a) of the Federal Reserve Act provides that the Board of Governors shall publish once each week a statement showing the condition of each Federal Reserve Bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve Banks. This section of the Act further provides that "such statements should show in detail the assets and liabilities of the Banks, single and combined, and shall furnish full information regarding the character of the money held as reserve and the amount, nature, and maturities of the paper and other investments owned or held by Federal Reserve Banks." The Board's weekly statement is published each Thursday and is compiled from the previous Wednesday's data. 60.20 Monthly Reporting 60.21 Monthly Report The reverse side of the District balance sheet, FR 34 (FR 34-Back), should be made available in the EASy application and balances that are recorded in Collateral Management System and Fedwire Securities Service applications should be retained and provided to RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section upon request. 60.22 Currency Held by Federal Reserve Banks Form FR 415 shows each type of paper money and coin held by the Reserve Bank at the end of the month.
