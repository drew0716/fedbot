Leaving the guarantee at its original amount until either expiration or settlement of the guarantee; A systematic and rational amortization of the value of the guarantee to income over the period of the guarantee. If the guarantee issued by a Reserve Bank is based on a change in an underlying, such as a change in the fair value of certain assets of the guaranteed party (market value guarantee), then the subsequent measurement of the liability should be based on marking the guarantee to market at each balance sheet date. This approach is especially relevant if the obligation was initially measured using a fair value approach. If a fair value approach is not feasible, then the value of the guarantee may be amortized over the period of the guarantee in a systematic and rational manner. Any residual liability that remains at the termination of the guarantee should be recorded to profit and loss in the period of the termination. For a guarantee whereby the Reserve Bank agrees to make loans to the guaranteed party based on the occurrence of a future event, the period of the guarantee expires when the maximum amount of loans required under the guarantee have been extended.
