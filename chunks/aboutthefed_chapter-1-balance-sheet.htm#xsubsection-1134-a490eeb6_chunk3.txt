its own purposes to prepare the balance sheet and to maintain satisfactory internal controls. This chapter provides general descriptions of the scope of the balance sheet accounts to promote uniformity of accounting treatment. It is not the intent of this manual to redefine basic accounting principles. In those cases where the accounting treatment is unclear, Reserve Banks should contact the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section for a FAM interpretation. Transactions of the Reserve Bank must be recorded in the general ledger and reflected on the Balance Sheet; none of the principles or possible lack of specific instructions for any given transaction in this manual should be interpreted as allowing otherwise. Proper accounting practice requires consistent application of accounting principles throughout the District (i.e., head office and Branches) from year to year. If this manual permits Reserve Banks to choose optional treatment for transactions, Reserve Banks should consistently apply the chosen option to all similar transactions. In general, the provisions of this manual address Reserve Bank accounting issues and should be applied from a District perspective (for example, the process for accruals required by paragraph 11.56 should be applied on a Districtwide basis rather than department or Branch basis).
