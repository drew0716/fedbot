Reserve Bank and Board staffs monitor actual performance and compare it with approved budgets and forecasts. Certain amounts relating to the prior year have been reclassified in the Combined Statements of Operations to conform to the current year presentation. $13 million previously reported as "Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits" as of March 31, 2018, and ($53 million) previously reported as "Operating expenses: Net periodic pension expense" as of March 31, 2018, have been reclassified as "Other items of income (loss): Other components of net benefits costs." In addition, in 2019, the description of the line item "Operating expenses: Net periodic pension expense" has been revised to "Operating expenses: Pension service cost" to better reflect the nature of the item. Additional information regarding Reserve Bank operating expenses is available each year in the Annual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report.htm , and on the Audit webpage of the Board's public website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/audit.htm .
