Return to table (4) Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) The combined financial statements include the accounts and operations of CPFF II, CCF, Main Street, MLF, and TALF II. The Reserve Banks that are controlling members have extended loans to the VIEs under the authority of section 13(3) of the FRA. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Purchases of each LLC's portfolio assets were funded by loans extended by the controlling Reserve Bank. The assets of the VIE and the amounts provided by the Treasury as credit protection are used to secure the loan from the Reserve Banks. In January 2021, CCF, Main Street, MLF, and TALF II returned a portion of the Treasury's equity investment in each facility. CPFF II ceased purchasing commercial paper on March 31, 2021. Prior to the conclusion of CPFF II, when all obligations of CPFF II were repaid, the remaining net assets were allocated and distributed to FRBNY and Treasury, in accordance with the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement of CPFF II. On June 29, 2021, CPFF II returned in full the Treasury's equity investment of $10 billion and Treasury's allocated portion of earnings of the LLC of $49 million, as reported in table 15a. Additionally, the Board announced in June 2021 plans to begin winding down the portfolio of CCF and begin sales to be conducted in a gradual and orderly manner. In accordance with the decision to wind down the portfolio, CCF reclassified investments in the portfolio from held-to-maturity to trading securities and recorded a net unrealized gain of $20 million from the reclassification of corporate bonds to fair value measurement from amortized cost. CCF concluded sales of its ETFs and corporate bonds in August 2021. On September 24, 2021, CCF returned the Treasury's remaining equity investment of $13.9 billion and the Treasury's earnings on non-marketable securities of $17 million, as reported in table 15a.
