another element, amortization should begin when the functionality of both elements are ready for their intended use. 11. Regular evaluation of assigned useful lives At a minimum, each Bank should assess annually the useful lives of software. Each Bank should also assess annually the amortization periods assigned to implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement that does not contain a software license. If there is a need to change the useful life or amortization period due to the effects of obsolescence, technology, and other economic factors, then revisions are made prospectively. As such, the current net book value is amortized over the revised remaining useful life. In cases where this analysis results in an extension of a useful life for software, the extension should not exceed the maximum allowed by FAM, which is five years. In unusual situations, a request to establish a longer life may be submitted for Board staff approval. 12. Impairment and write-off of software development costs or software assets Significant events or changes in operating circumstances warrant a review to determine whether the carrying value of an existing software asset or capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement that does not contain a software license
