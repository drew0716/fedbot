Return to table (D) Depository Institution Deposits The Reserve Banks pay interest to depository institutions on qualifying balances held at the Reserve Banks. Effective March 26, 2020, the Board of Governors has reduced reserve requirements ratios to zero, and all balances held are excess balances, as reported in note 5. Effective July 29, 2021, the Board of Governors eliminated references to an interest on required reserves (IORR) rate and to an interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate and replaced them with a single interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. This action eliminates reserve requirements for thousands of depository institutions and will help to support lending to households and businesses. The interest rate paid on excess balances is determined by the Board of Governors, based on a FOMC-established target range for the federal funds rate. Effective March 16, 2022, the FOMC increased the established target range for the federal funds rate. The Reserve Banks also offer term deposits through the Term Deposit Facility, and all depository institutions that are eligible to receive interest on their balances at the Reserve Banks may participate in the term deposit program. The interest rate paid on these deposits is determined by auction. (E) Operating Expenses The Federal Reserve Banks have established procedures for budgetary control and monitoring of operating expenses as part of their efforts to ensure appropriate stewardship and accountability. Reserve Bank and Board governance bodies provide budget guidance for major functional areas for the upcoming budget year. The Board's Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Affairs (BAC) reviews the Banks' budgets, and the BAC chair submits the budgets to Board members for review and final action. Throughout the year, Reserve Bank and Board staffs monitor actual performance and compare it with approved budgets and forecasts. Additional information regarding Reserve Bank operating expenses is available each year in the Annual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report.htm , and on the Audit webpage of the Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/audit.htm .
