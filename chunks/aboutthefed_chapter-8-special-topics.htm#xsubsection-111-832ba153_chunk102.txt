paragraph 82.01 Consolidation for additional discussion of SPE. Return to text 18. The subsequent measurement of a guarantee liability under FASB ASC Topic 460-10 discussed here does not encompass (and therefore, is separate from) the recognition and subsequent adjustment of the contingent liability under FASB ASC Topic 450-20 relating to the contingent loss for the guarantee. FASB ASC Topic 460-10 in general requires the recognition of a guarantee liability in an earlier stage when it is not probable that the triggering events will occur (and therefore, a FASB ASC Topic 450-20 contingent liability will not be recognized). When it becomes probable that a liability will be incurred, a FASB ASC Topic 450-20 contingent liability needs to be assessed and the greater of (a) FASB ASC Topic 460-10 guarantee liability at fair value or (b) FASB ASC Topic 450-20 contingent liability should be recorded.
