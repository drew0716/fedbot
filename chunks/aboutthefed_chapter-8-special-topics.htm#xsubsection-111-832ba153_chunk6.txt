The estimate of expected credit losses is based on historical loss information, adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. FASB Topic ASC 326-20 requires that upon initial inception or purchase of the loan, and subsequently at each reporting date, the recognition of an allowance for credit losses generally in a consistent manner over the lifetime (in most cases the contractual maturity) of the loan.
