automatic trade, provided that any purchases made with the contributions involve permissible assets under the Policy for Covered Individuals. Q62: Is an automatic dividend reinvestment plan for a diversified mutual fund or diversified ETF a permissible qualifying automatic trade program? Updated: 4/15/2022 A62: Yes. Mutual funds and ETFs generally distribute dividends on a quarterly basis, although some may issue dividends more infrequently (such as annually). Covered individuals may choose to automatically reinvest dividends issued by a diversified mutual fund or diversified ETF, and these will be considered permissible qualifying automatic trade programs. Q63: Are limit orders considered to be qualifying automatic trades? Are they permissible under the Policy for Covered Individuals? Updated: 2/5/2024 A63: No. A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better and if the price is not met, the trade is not executed. This type of transaction does not comply with the requirement that a trade be non-retractable and executed during an identified trade window as required under sections 2(c)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(iii) of the policy. Thus, limit orders and other transactions that will only occur based on the satisfaction of a contingency do not comply with the policy.
