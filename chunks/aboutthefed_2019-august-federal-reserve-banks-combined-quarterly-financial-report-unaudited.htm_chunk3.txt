The par amount shown for federal agency and GSE MBS is the remaining principal balance of the securities. Return to table Federal agency and GSE MBS are reported at stated maturity in table 5 above. The estimated weighted-average life of these securities, which differs from the stated maturity in table 5 primarily because it factors in scheduled payments and prepayment assumptions, was approximately 5.4 years and 7.0 years as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Because of the global character of bank funding markets, the Federal Reserve has at times coordinated with other central banks to provide liquidity. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorized and directed the FRBNY to maintain standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The FRBNY holds amounts outstanding under these swap lines in the SOMA. These swap lines, which were originally established as temporary arrangements, were converted to standing arrangements on October 31, 2013, and will remain in place until further notice. The remaining maturity distribution of U.S. dollar liquidity swaps that were allocated to the Reserve Banks at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was as follows: Table 9.
