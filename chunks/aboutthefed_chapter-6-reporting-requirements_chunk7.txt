Treasury that are required by the Federal Reserve Act is reported as "Earnings remittances to the Treasury, net" in the Combined Statements of Operations. Before the implementation of the FAST Act, the Board of Governors, under authority of Section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act, had established the following described rate of interest on the outstanding Federal Reserve notes of each Bank less the amount of gold certificates pledged with the Federal Reserve Agent: The interest rate on Federal Reserve notes not covered by gold certificates pledged with the Federal Reserve Agent as collateral security for such notes shall be the result of the division of (a) the net earnings of the Federal Reserve Bank after provision for dividends on its outstanding Capital Paid In and for adjustments necessary to equate the amount of its Surplus with the amount of its Capital Paid In, by (b) the daily average amount of Outstanding Federal Reserve Notes of the Bank after deducting the daily average amount of gold certificates pledged with the Federal Reserve Agent as collateral security for such notes. Daily Accrual Earnings remittances to Treasury are accrued each day at an amount equal to the end-of-day balance in the Retained Earnings â Current Year account 330-275. Additionally, the Reserve Bank's surplus balance must be adjusted to ensure it does not exceed the Bank's portion of the aggregate surplus limitation. After recording this daily accrual and the surplus adjustment, if needed, the balance in the Retained Earnings â Current Year account 330-275 should be zero. Weekly Remittances The remittance to Treasury should be made each Wednesday. The amount of the remittance should be equal to the lower of the liability (credit) balance in the Accrued Remittances to Treasury / Deferred Asset account 240-925: For the previous Wednesday, or For the day preceding the remittance If, however, either of the two balances described above is zero or if the balance is a debit, no remittance should be made. In such cases, remittances to Treasury should not resume until sufficient net earnings have been realized to return the balance in the Accrued Remittances to Treasury / Deferred Asset account 240-925 to a liability (credit). A Reserve Bank should consult the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section if it is aware of a significant entry on the remittance day that would have affected the remittance amount had it been recorded on the previous day. Each Wednesday, Reserve Banks will transfer to the FRB Richmond the amount owed to the Treasury. If the Wednesday is a holiday, the FRB Richmond will remit the amounts owed to the Treasury on the next business day. Special procedures exist for the first remittance of each calendar year. Year-End Procedures The income, expense, and other capital accounts on the year-end FR 34 should include all amounts applicable to the year up to and including December 31, based on the best data available to the Reserve Bank on December 31. The net income on the FR 34 on December 31 should be fully distributed; the surplus should be adjusted to the level of the Bank's portion of the aggregate surplus limit. The necessary entries to adjust surplus are described in paragraph 12.10 . A credit balance in the Accrued Remittances to Treasury / Deferred Asset account 240-925 represents the amount of the first remittance to Treasury in January, which will be made on the first Wednesday in January or on the next business day if Wednesday is a holiday. Similar to the weekly procedures described above, losses or other circumstances that occur in the intervening week may require adjustment to the remittance amount. RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section should be contacted if the Bank determines that this remittance will be different than the amount recorded in FR 34 account 240-925 as of December 31. A debit balance in the Accrued Remittances to Treasury / Deferred Asset account 240-925 represents the amount of net earnings that a Reserve Bank will need to realize before remittances to Treasury resume. In this case, the Bank will not make a remittance to Treasury on the first Wednesday in January. On the January year-end closing date designated by the Board, the previous year's income, expense, and other capital account balances except for capital paid in and surplus are removed from the balance sheet. The amounts removed should be final data for the year as determined by the Reserve Bank and should agree dollar for dollar with the results for the year, which are reported elsewhere, such as in the annual CASPR reports and the reports on income from services. In some instances, due to the availability of additional information, adjustments to year-end balances may be identified subsequent to December 31 but prior to removing the previous year's income and expenses and other capital accounts data from the balance sheet. Such adjusting entries should be functioned to December 31 balances during the closing process when they serve to more accurately and completely reflect the financial condition of the Reserve Bank. Communication of these adjustments should be made to RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section through submission of the WTB. As a practical matter, the annual year-end accounting instructions (that include the financial statement shell including footnotes) are sent to the Banks during the year-end process to provide additional detailed reporting instructions. 60.95 RBOPS Financial Accounting Reports System (RFARS) Reserve Banks are required to submit certain financial accounting reports to the Board electronically using RFARS, the WTB, or email. 4 The reports in RFARS include the following: FR 415 âCurrency Held by Federal Reserve Banks (monthly) FR 612 âBook Value of Bank Premises and Other Real Estate (annually, and as property is purchased/sold).

A link to RFARS is located on RBOPS webpage on the Board's website under "Reserve Bank Oversight" and "Financial Management."
