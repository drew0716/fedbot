to twice the par value of stock subscribed by it. The FRA requires each Reserve Bank to pay each member bank an annual dividend on paid in capital stock. By law member banks with more than $10 billion of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to the smaller of 6 percent or the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less of total consolidated assets, adjusted annually for inflation, receive a dividend on paid in capital stock equal to 6 percent. The dividend is paid semiannually and is cumulative. In 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act reduced the statutory limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus from $10.0 billion to $6.825 billion, which required Reserve Banks to make two lump sum payments to the Treasury totaling $3.125 billion. These lump sum payments were reported as a component of "Earnings remittances to the Treasury" in the Combined statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
