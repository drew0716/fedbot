"bonds or notes of the United States" used in this Act shall be held to include certificates of indebtedness and Treasury bills issued under section 3104 of title 31. [12 USC 221. As amended by acts of June 25, 1959 (73 Stat. 142) and Sept. 13, 1982 (96 Stat. 1058). For further definitions, see section 2 of Banking Act of 1933, approved June 16, 1933. Section 203(a) of the Banking Act of 1935, approved Aug. 23, 1935 (49 Stat. 704), provided: "Hereafter the Federal Reserve Board shall be known as the 'Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System', and the governor and vice governor of the Federal Reserve Board shall be known as the 'chairman' and the 'vice chairman', respectively, of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System." Accordingly, the words "Federal Reserve Board", "governor", and "vice governor", wherever they formerly appeared in the Federal Reserve Act (or in other acts of Congress), have been changed here to read "Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System", "chairman" and "vice chairman", respectively, notwithstanding the fact that such change has not been made by specific amendment of the law. * An identical amendment was made by act of Oct. 16, 2006 (120 Stat. 2028).
