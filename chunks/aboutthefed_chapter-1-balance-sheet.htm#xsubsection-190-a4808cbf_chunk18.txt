Each Bank pledges the full amount in the SDR certificate account as collateral for Federal Reserve notes under a continuing pledge agreement. 2.30 Coin (130-025) This account represents all United States coin held by the Reserve Banks except gold coin and coin in exhibits. For shipments of coin between Districts in which the shipment is not received on the same day the coin is shipped, the receiving District should establish a sub-account, defined as an in transit coin account, and follow the same accounting explained in paragraph 50.40 for shipments of notes between Districts. 2.40 Loans (140-025, 140-050, 140-055, and 140-057) Extensions of credit by Federal Reserve Banks are governed by Regulation A and Operating Circular 10 of each Bank. Loans to depository institutions are carried at face amount in a single account on the balance sheet. The interest is accrued on a daily basis and collected at maturity. Loans to depository institutions are pledged by each Reserve Bank as collateral for Federal Reserve notes.
