losses on works of art. The account should not normally be used to adjust prior year income or expenses except for the correction of prior year accounting errors when the amount would seriously distort income or expenses of the current year. Entries to the account for prior year items may be made only with the prior approval of the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section. The profit and loss account should not include dividends and rebates on insurance policies or any additional premium payments on worker's compensation or other insurance regardless of the year for which the refunds or additional payments apply. Such amounts should be entered to current year income or expenses. Other items from the previous year, which should normally be applied to current year income or expenses rather than profit and loss, are receipts from vending machines, refunds from courier contracts, adjustments for the difference between accounts payable and the actual billings, and adjustments for the difference between accrued income from services and actual billings. The profit and loss account should also exclude losses arising from the ongoing operations of the Reserve Banks. Any such losses should be charged to current expense. 60.35 Annual Reporting 60.36
