into production. When constructing a building, if it is occupied prior to closing the Construction account, depreciation should be estimated as closely as possible and applied to current expense effective in the month following when at least 50 percent of the Reserve Bank's staff is operating from the new quarters. Any adjustments for over or under estimates of depreciation, as may be determined when the Construction account is closed and final figures for Building and Equipment are capitalized, should be adjusted to current expense in the current month. For all fixed assets (except software) reported on the balance sheet, depreciation starts the month following when the fixed asset is placed into service. Depreciation is recorded by debiting current expense and crediting the related allowance for depreciation on the balance sheet. Thus, the amount of accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet represents the sum of the individual depreciation charges for each asset that have been recorded in the subsidiary accounts of the Bank. Assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The depreciable basis of an asset is its acquisition cost less its estimated salvage value. The formula for calculating the straight-line method of depreciation is as follows: Cost less Salvage
