to accommodate its growing staff, eventually resulting in the William McChesney Martin Jr. Building. Reflecting the Federal Reserve's new administrative, regulatory, and supervisory responsibilities, Board staff continued to grow to support its expanded functions during a post-war period characterized by economic expansion. In 1962, the Board commissioned the architecture firm Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson (H2L2) to design the new building for the vacant block lying immediately north of the Eccles Building across C Street. H2L2 consisted of Paul Philippe Cret's former partners, who continued the practice Cret had founded under their own names. H2L2's design for the Martin Building was completed in the 1960s, and reflected a contemporary interpretation of classicism that incorporated materials similar to those used in the Eccles Building construction. The building's interior was designed to provide maximum flexibility of office space through movable partitions and modular furniture as well as optimum energy utilization. Throughout the construction process, the Board worked in conjunction with the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission, a federal agency charged with preserving and enhancing Washington, D.C., as a "Federal City." Construction began in April 1971 and was completed in 1974. The building was dedicated on November
