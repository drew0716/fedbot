will be the same for each team. The question period is an opportunity to determine the extent to which students are knowledgeable about the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, and the information in their presentation. Questions could be of four types: follow-up questions related to data, analyses, or recommendations made during the presentation (e.g., What evidence do you have to support your statement that deflation is more of a risk to the U.S. economy than inflation? How might your recommendation affect the economic circumstances of different areas or groups?) hypothetical questions (e.g., Suppose the number of new jobs created over the next three months totaled 100,000, would that change your prescription for monetary policy?) questions about macroeconomic theory (e.g., How much weight should policymakers give the Phillips curve?) questions about the Federal Reserve (e.g., Once the FOMC reaches its decision, how are policy decisions implemented?) Participate in the in-person final presentation and Q&A session. Team presents their 15-minute presentation. No new slides or data should be introduced within the presentation. Judges will ask each team at least two similar questions. These questions will be the same for each team. Judges may modify their questions to cover topics mentioned in a teamâ€™s
