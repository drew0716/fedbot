Book Value of Bank Premises or Other Real Estate Form FR 612 is a summary of changes in the book value of Bank premises and other real estate and should be submitted to the RBOPS Financial Accounting Policy and Reporting Section by the date specified within the RBOPS provided year-end instructions. The annual FR 612 is the primary source of data for completion of the Annual Report table, Acquisition Costs and Net Book Value of Premises (including vaults) of the Federal Reserve Banks and Branches. An FR 612 report should also be submitted whenever property is purchased or sold. Bank-Owned Property Leased to Outside Tenants and Non-Bank-Owned Property Leased for Bank Use Form FR 892 is dual purpose because it is used to report either the lease of Bank-owned property to outside tenants or the lease of non-Bank-owned property (outside space) for Bank use. Each office should submit an annual report, indicating lease or rental agreements in effect on December 31. A report should be submitted whether or not the office is leasing or renting space. In addition to operations and office space, the report should identify leases for functions such as warehouse, storage, screening, etc. If there are no leases in effect at the end of the calendar year, this should be indicated in the body of the report. Form FR 892 should reach the RBOPS Building Planning Section by January 20 or the next business day of the year following the reporting period. In addition, a report should be submitted whenever a change occurs in a lease or rental agreement including identifying new and/or terminated leases. The reporting form is designed to accommodate information concerning several leases or rental agreements. In submitting the data, each lease or agreement should be shown on a separate line of the report. If an office is both leasing Bank-owned property to outside tenants and leasing non-Bank-owned property for Bank use, separate reports should be submitted covering each type of transaction, rather than combining them on the same report. Financial accounting and facility management staff are encouraged to collaborate to provide the appropriate information to complete the reports. Following are specific instructions concerning the data to be reported as of December 31 under the various columns of this report. Bank-owned Property Leased to Outside Tenants Location of space âIdentify the location of the leased space within the building
