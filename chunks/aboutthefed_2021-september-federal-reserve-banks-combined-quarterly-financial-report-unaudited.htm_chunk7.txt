(4) Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) The combined financial statements include the accounts and operations of CPFF II, CCF, Main Street, MLF, and TALF II. The Reserve Banks that are controlling members have extended loans to the VIEs under the authority of section 13(3) of the FRA. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Purchases of each LLC's portfolio assets were funded by loans extended by the controlling Reserve Bank. The assets of the VIE and the amounts provided by the Treasury as credit protection are used to secure the loan from the Reserve Banks. In January 2021, CCF, Main Street, MLF, and TALF II returned a portion of the Treasury's equity investment in each facility. CPFF II ceased purchasing commercial paper on March 31, 2021.
