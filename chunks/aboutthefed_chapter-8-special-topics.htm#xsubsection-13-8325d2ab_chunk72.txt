basis, any previously recognized allowance for credit losses should be written off and the amortized cost basis shall be written down to the security's fair value at the reporting date, with any incremental impairment subsequently reported in income. At subsequent reporting periods, the previous amortized cost basis less the amounts written off (inclusive of non-credit related impairment reported in earnings) is considered to be the new amortized cost basis of the investment and it should not be adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. No —proceed to question 3 below to consider the underlying reason for the decline in fair value of the security under evaluation for impairment. Question 3: Is the decrease in fair value below the amortized cost noted in question 1 a result of credit loss, or is it driven by a factor other than credit losses, such as a change in market rates, not related to credit considerations of the underlying issuer of the security?
