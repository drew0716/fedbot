to base fair value on the prices for similar assets (appraisal). The remaining method is to use the discounted present value of the expected cash flows for the asset. In general, assumptions and techniques used to determine fair value should be the same that marketplace participants would use if the information is available without undue cost and effort. Otherwise, the Reserve Bank should use its own assumptions. In general, absent reasonable appraisals of market, the undiscounted amount calculated in step three will be used for those assets that will be disposed of within five years. If applied to an asset that will be held for longer than five years such as a building, use the applicable Treasury rate for a security of that duration as of the impairment date. The impairment loss should be recorded as an adjustment to the asset account (proportionately to assets in a group) and a charge to the same account that would have been charged if the asset was sold. Fair Value After adjusting the carrying value for an impairment loss, consider adjusting the remaining useful life and salvage value assumptions from the impairment date. Once the adjustment is recorded, subsequent restoration is not permitted.
