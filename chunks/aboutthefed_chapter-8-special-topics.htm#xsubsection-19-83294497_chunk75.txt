measuring impairment on the available-for-sale security, the amounts should be the Reserve Bank's best estimate based on the historic performance of the security, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Elements specific to the security, such as the remaining maturity of the security, potential prepayment activity, underlying financial health of the issuer, value/type of collateral, and expected future credit events (i.e., default or bankruptcy), should be used when estimating the amount and timing of collection of expected future cash flows. Available information directly related to the collectability of the security, including industry, economic, or regulatory factors, should also be considered when developing an estimate. Refer to FASB Topic ASC 326-30 for a full list of considerations that the Reserve Bank should review when estimating impairment on an available-for-sale security using expected future cash flows. Once the measurement of credit loss on the security has been determined by the Reserve Bank, the impairment should be recognized by recording an allowance for credit losses. As stated previously, this amount is limited by the difference between the calculated fair value of the security, less the amortized cost basis. Impairment determined to not be related to credit specific factors (i.e., a change
