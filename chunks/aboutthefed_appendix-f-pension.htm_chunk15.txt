the System Plan in a manner that is consistent with the accounting for a single employer plan. System Plan assets, liabilities, costs and all required footnote disclosures are reflected in its financial statements, and net periodic pension costs are presented as a component of its net income from operations. Each of the other participating employers account for the System Plan in a manner similar to a multiple employer plan; no disclosure of plan assets, liabilities, and costs would be made in the financial statements of the other eleven Banks, and BOG as discussed earlier. Limited disclosure regarding the reporting entity of the System Plan is required. Though the characterization as a single or multiemployer plan affects the accounting and disclosure, there is no requirement to state specifically that a plan is being accounted for as either a single or multiemployer plan. Financial statement disclosures provide users information about the participating employers and the FRBA's role, on behalf of the System, in recognizing the net asset/liability and costs and that the other participating employers do not reimburse the FRBA for the Plan costs. In addition, when they are made, the FRBA discloses the amount of contributions. Footnotes 1. CFPB employees may
